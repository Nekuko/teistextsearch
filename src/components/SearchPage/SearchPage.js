In fact, it buried itself deeper in my heart, never dying out and always guiding me through life. To become stronger, I learned everything from karate to boxing, from swordplay to mixed martial arts. I hammed it up during all my practices, concealing my true power from the world and preparing for the fated day.",

                "I'll try to explain. Let's say someone is on a quest for magical powers. Anyone would think they're nuts. Hell, I know I would. I'd think they'd gone bonkers.",
                "But consider this: No one in the world has proved that magic exists—or disproved it.",
                "I couldn't find these powers with my sanity intact. I had to dive to the depths of lunacy.",
                "I started training in a new way that was damn near impossible.",
                "After all, no one knows how to acquire magic, mana, chi, auras, or what have you.",
                "I practiced Zen meditation; I braved the purification ceremony of standing under waterfalls; I focused my entire being inward; I fasted; I mastered the art of yoga; I converted religions; I searched for holy spirits; I prayed to god; I strapped myself to a cross. There was no right answer, which meant I groped my way through the darkness and sprinted down my chosen path.",
                "Which brings us here. I'm just about ready to start my final summer as a high schooler, and I've yet to discover magic or mana or chi or auras...",
                "It is already dark by the time I finish my daily training session.",
                "I pick up and put on my underwear, which I'd chucked to the side, and wiggle my arms through the sleeves of my school uniform. I have yet to pick up these secret magical skills, but I've been starting to feel the effects of my training, I think, of late.",
                "Like right now.",
                "I can see flashing lights going off in my mind and sense the world is spinning.",
                "It could be magic...or auras... In either case, I'm feeling its effects—that's for sure. I'm proud to announce that I've completed another successful session.",
                "When I'm in the thick of it, I rip off every single article of clothing and get buck naked in the forest. It makes me one with the universe. I bash my skull into the trunk of a giant tree to physically force out my worldly thoughts. Plus, it stimulates my brain and urges my latent powers to awaken.",
                "You know, I'm all about logic when it comes to these things.",
                "Yeah, everything's beginning to get all blurry right about now. It's a sensation comparable to giving myself a concussion. I make my way out of the forest with the lightest of footsteps, feeling like I'm treading on clouds.",
                "Just then, I see light—two beams floating in the air and slicing through space. How strange. They're beckoning me, guiding me somewhere.",
                "\"Ma-magic...?\" I whisper, tiptoeing toward the illumination.",
                "It must be... It's gotta be! I finally found the powers of the unknown!",
                "I notice that I've gone from walking to sprinting, tripping over the roots of trees and continuing to stagger forward—on and on like a beast in the forest.",
                "\"Magic! Magic! Magic! MAGIC, MAGIC, MAGIC!!!!!\" I chant, bounding toward the lights and ready to snatch them out of midair...",
                "\"Hmm...?\"",
                "As a pair of headlights flood my vision with a blinding whiteness, I hear the shrill whine of a sudden brake ringing and ringing.",
                "And then a collision. Its impact pierces through my body... And my magic...",
                "In conclusion, I was able to find magical powers.",
                "When I open my eyes, I sense that I'm surrounded by its energy, though I gotta admit it looks different from the two lights. Eh, no biggie.",
                "Oh, and one other small detail: As a side effect, I manage to reincarnate. I bet I opened a door to another world when I found magic or something. Whatever.",
                "As for right now, I'm a baby boy, a few months old. I only recently started forming thoughts, but it's still hard for me to guess how much time has elapsed at any given moment. Plus, I don't know any words, but I guess it's plenty to recognize that this civilization is more or less the same as Europe in the Middle Ages.",
                "But none of that's important. I've acquired magical powers. That's the end-all be-all. I couldn't care less about how it happened or any bonus features.",
                "I notice magic as soon as I start displaying glimmers of consciousness. All around me, I can see minuscule grains of light floating and shimmering. It reminds me of those times in my past life when I frolicked through a field of flowers stark naked—to train and find spirits, obviously.",
                "As it turns out, my training wasn't a total waste after all. I mean, my ability to detect this energy is proof enough, and I can control it as easily as my limbs. It's comparable to when I strapped my naked body to a cross, a nod to Jesus...or maybe when I flip-flopped religions and danced around in prayer in my birthday suit... I bet every little thing in my training sessions helped me in the long run. It's already taught me that I can get stronger.",
                "Plus, time is of no consequence for a baby. I'm ready to use these years to train and become an eminence in shadow, once and for all... Oops, I think I've made a doodie.",
                "Which reminds me. I heard somewhere that birds let their droppings dribble out involuntarily, and I think human babies are the same. I can fight the good fight with logic and reasoning, but it feels as though my instincts take over, whispering Just do it in my ear.",
                "That said, this is me we're talking about. I spent my waking hours training in my past life. Pooling together all the strength in my body, I tighten my sphincter, buying me some time...",
                "\"Wwwaaaahhhhh!\"",
                "...to summon people.",
                "I think it's been ten years.",
                "You know, magic is something else. It means I can surpass the bodily limitations of humans: lift ginormous boulders with a single finger, dash twice as fast as a horse, leap higher than a house.",
                "That said, I'm no match for nukes. Well, I know my defenses will increase with my magical capacity, but have you seen the firepower of those weapons on Earth? There was a time when I contemplated forgetting about them entirely, 'cause we don't have nukes in this world.",
                "But what good is a master puppeteer who settles for less?",
                "No good. Not at all.",
                "That means my next mission is to become strong enough to beat weapons of mass destruction. After extensive research and training, I found one potential solution, which I've been incorporating into my daily experiments.",
                "Oh yeah. And it seems I've been born into a noble family. For generations, members of this family have trained to become dark knights, who use magic to power up and slay enemies in battle. And as my family's rising star of a son (...NOT), I'm living my days as your average apprentice. After all, shadowbrokers need to be extremely selective about when, where, and to whom they reveal their powers. Yeah...I'll lie in wait until then.",
                "I know I'm not exerting my true potential and that I am cutting corners, but I learned some skills as an apprentice that have come in handy. Like how magic is used on the battlefield in this world. It's been a good opportunity for me to reflect on my own techniques.",
                "To be completely honest, it's clear to me the fighting styles from my past life were a hundred times more logical and refined than the ones here. I mean, look at any contemporary martial arts battle. These fighters rebuke unnecessary movements, drawing from various combat schools and whittling them down to the crème de la crème. This creates the conditions for the \"perfect\" fight. It relies on the rules of the game, of course, but this mental attitude can be used to identify the best of the best in any situation.",
                "And then consider this world. First and foremost, their fighting techniques stay in their country of origin. Which means different schools of combat don't cross borders. Plus, there are certain secret skills that countries won't allow out of their jurisdiction—not that we'd be able to spread them to begin with, since no forms of media are readily available to us. This means we can't combine techniques from other forms of fighting, much less reject or improve our own.",
                "If I had to describe this system in one word, I'd call it unrefined.",
                "But there's one fundamental difference between the two worlds. That's right: magic. It completely changes the baseline of physical performance.",
                "Take physical strength, for example.",
                "I can lift someone up with one hand, which means any knowledge about hand-to-hand combat and wrestling, or \"ground fighting,\" goes out the window. Even if we're in a mounted grappling position, I can soar through the air by flexing my abs. If I've got my foot hooked on an opponent in an offensive guard, I can blast them off me by activating my leg muscles. Yeah. Ground fighting is out of the question.",
                "It's like how humans have their method of combat and gorillas have a breed of their own. And I'll just leave it at that.",
                "There are also differences in the distance and speed at which combatants step into their attacks—meaning it's harder to predict their movements in battle. This might be the most important thing. I mean, martial arts are all about reading your opponent at an appropriate range. The angle, position, and distance of your attacks are everything.",
                "It took me a while to get the hang of the last one, especially because these fighters attack from afar. Like sixteen feet apart. I mean, I guess I get it. They're lightning fast and take ginormous steps, and I'd just assumed this was their way of fighting...until I realized it was to compensate for their poor defense tactics.",
                "I'm sure this is relatable to all martial artists: Those who can't guard will stand too far from their opponents.",
                "It's really scary to get hit. I get it. It's tempting to retreat to where your opponent can't reach you. But this results in a contest where one fighter attacks and the other retreats, and vice versa, which is a real snore. You call this outboxing? Try again. This is just an exercise of running back and forth.",
                "It doesn't matter if the fighters are five or a hundred meters apart. They can't land a decent hit either way. It could be six or seven or ten meters—it's all the same.",
                "This has been a public service announcement to close the gap and duke it out.",
                "But once you cross a certain threshold, one millimeter can make a huge difference. And it stands at the exact point where I can both land a blow and react to an attack. Throw in other factors like the angle of my hits, and the slightest turn can mean an advantage—or a disadvantage. The narrowest of margins is the best range between two fighters.",
                "A battle shouldn't be about one combatant dashing in sixteen feet and the other leaping back nineteen.",
                "I guess I came into this whole thing with an idea of what to expect from other worlds, which—compounded with my unfamiliarity with magic—left me confused about their combat scene. But, eh, I've gotten my bearings straight as of late. It's all chill now.",
                "I train every day at home, where our dad basically directs us on how to throw down, and I grapple with my older sister. I know she's only two years older than me, but she has natural talent, according to everyone else. If she keeps it up, she's the one who will take over as head of the family, which isn't uncommon in this world, since magic can make women powerful enough to become the heir.",
                "\"Geez, you're so strong...,\" I whimper every day as she kicks my ass.",
                "But I can't win. If I want to become a shadow commander, I've got to establish myself as the most average of all background characters.",
                "That's how I've been living out my day-to-day. Tack on lessons about how to act as an aristocrat and hanging out with people to secure my place as a low-profile extra, and I've barely got any free time during the day.",
                "Which means the only time for me to train is after everyone else has gone to bed, late into the night. I may be cutting into my beauty sleep, but I've been using magic to recover super-quick and meditation to catch some z's in new ways. And now, I've pretty much got short sleeper syndrome. I make it work.",
                "Okay, time to get down to business. I blast through my usual training regimen in the forest. I've got something special planned today.",
                "I heard that rogues have taken up residence in the ghost town nearby. According to my investigation, it's a large gang of thieves—and the perfect opportunity to test my new weapon.",
                "I take down bandits here and there. But a whole group of criminals? That's the event of the year. And I'm always short on sparring partners, so I welcome evildoers with open arms.",
                "Oh, please, please, please infest this place with more crime!",
                "I think it's standard for villages to try to deal with offenders on their own terms, but they mostly get away scot-free. I mean, our judicial system is in the city, which is why I've decided to take the law into my own hands.",
                "Today marks the historic day of my first official battle with my newest weapon. I've been experimenting with it for months and call it the \"slime bodysuit.\"",
                "Allow me to explain.",
                "We can use magic in this world to strengthen our bodies and weapons, but there are energy losses when it's transferred from one form to another. For example, if I run one hundred currents of magic through an average steel sword, only 10 percent of them will be of use in combat. A whopping 90 percent is lost. Even a mithril sword, which is known to be compatible with magic. It's considered high-end if it performs at 50 percent capacity.",
                "That's when slimes caught my eye. A slime is a magical being that uses energy to change form and wobble from place to place. According to my research, I've found they have a conductivity of an astonishing 99 percent. On top of that, they're in a liquid state, which means they can change their shape at will.",
                "I started testing slime jellies after capturing and crushing their cores—easily more than a thousand of them. In fact, I pushed them to the brink of extinction in my area by killing too many and had to go on an expedition to find more.",
                "The jellies are easy to handle and strong, to boot. I successfully molded the slime into a wearable bodysuit, which is super-lightweight and silent, unlike armor. Plus, it almost, like, supports my movements? And I've given it killer defenses, of course.",
                "As for right now, I'm wrapped in a black slime bodysuit. It's a simple, no-frills getup that fits my body perfectly, except for eyes, nostrils, and mouth. I'm virtually indistinguishable from the criminal in a certain famous detective manga.",
                "I might want to think up a more suitable design when I'm intervening in a scheme as a full-fledged shadowbroker.",
                "I manage to arrive at the ghost town late into the night, but I can see a few lights in the darkness. The thieves seem to be having a feast to celebrate their robbing of merchants. Wow, I'm super-lucky.",
                "You see, thieves aren't good at planning, and they immediately squander what they steal, which means they only have something decent right after a successful attack. And one man's treasure is another man's treasure. What's theirs is mine. This is how I'll get the funds to become a puppet master.",
                "Anyway, I crash their feast, excited as all hell—not with a surprise attack, because that won't make for a good practice session.",
                "\"Yahoo! Hand over the loot, scumbags!\" I shriek in the middle of their banquet.",
                "\"Wh-who the hell is this puny dude?!\"",
                "I mean, I'm only ten years old. Like, duh. It's only natural that I'm short.",
                "\"You heard me! Now fork over the goods!\" I shout, punting the rude man across the room for calling me small.",
                "The other thieves finally draw their weapons.",
                "\"Hey, keep it up, and we ain't gonna hold back, you bra—...!\"",
                "\"Take that!\" I exclaim as I slice through his neck, severing his head from his shoulders midsentence.",
                "That's right. My sword is made of slime, which means I can draw it from my bodysuit when the situation calls for it. And it has a bunch of nifty functions.",
                "Number one. It can elongate.",
                "\"Take that! And that! And that!\" I extend my sword and slay all the dinky thieves in the vicinity.",
                "I stretch the slime out in the shape of a whip with edges as sharp as a sword. It's my first time wielding it, so I'm a tad nervous, but I can totally see how it might come in handy.",
                "\"And that! And that! And...huh?\"",
                "I notice the room has gone all silent as I get a little too carried away with slashing and slicing around me.",
                "Wait, is there only one guy left?",
                "\"Wh-who are you...?\"",
                "\"Eh, I guess you'll be my guinea pig for function number two.\"",
                "\"Th-the hell do you mean...?!\"",
                "\"To break it down, you look stronger than the rest of them. I'm assuming you're like their boss or something, right? Your chances of winning are squat, but if you let me practice on you, I bet you'll live for, like, two extra minutes. Good luck.\"",
                "\"S-stop playing, you brat! In the capital, I'm the—...!\"",
                "\"Hey, you. Skip the speech and come at me.\"",
                "\"Die, dammit!\" booms the Boss (or whatever) as he closes the distance between us, taking his sweet old time to swing at me, and I obviously...don't budge.",
                "His sword plunges straight into my chest, and I'm thrown to the ground on impact.",
                "\"Ha-ha! That's what you get for messin' with me! I've mastered the Royal Bushin method, and... Wh-what?!\"",
                "\"Ta-daa! ...You couldn't even scratch me.\"",
                "I rise to my feet as if nothing happened, and wow, I couldn't be happier with my suit's defenses! I mean, these weak-as-shit attacks can't even touch me.",
                "\"I've heard it seems to be all the rage in the capital. Show me.\"",
                "\"Damn you!\" swears the Boss as he strikes me.",
                "Yeah. No sweat. As he swings his sword with all his might, I don't even ready mine, sidestepping and ducking to dodge him, no problem.",
                "The Royal Bushin method, was it? I could get into their ways of wielding the sword.",
                "I mean, it's not every day you get to see someone fighting over something other than spirituality, old-fashioned standards, or personal beliefs in this world. This was a fight motivated by logic. I can see it from his clumsy set of attacks.",
                "In the length of a second, a small step forward.",
                "I see him calculate his next strike and take creative approaches. That said, his attacks leave a lot to be desired, and in the next free moment, I step just out of his range.",
                "\"Wh-why...why can't I hit you?!\"",
                "\"I mean, you're weaker than my old man. Though I guess you're stronger than my sister. Not that it means anything. And I bet she'll whup your butt in another year.\"",
                "\"You little shiiiiiiiiiiit!\" he screeches, frantically bashing his sword in my direction.",
                "I parry his advances before kicking him lightly in the shin—snapping my leg forward quickly as though on reflex.",
                "\"Gwah, ah! Why...?\" the Boss whimpers, curling into a fetal position and clutching his leg.",
                "Blood drips from his shin and pools on the ground.",
                "It's a cheap trick, you know. I have a blade as sharp as an ice pick sticking out from my toes.",
                "The second handy-dandy feature of the slime sword is that I can wield my blade from wherever and whenever I want. I thought this tactic showed the most potential. All I have to do is get in front of the enemy and slash him with the sword in my shoe, since lower-body attacks are hard to block. I parry hits, lock blades, and give my opponent a kick. It's nothing flashy, but it gets the job done.",
                "\"I guess we're through.\"",
                "\"W-wait...!\"",
                "\"You didn't even last two minutes,\" I note before kicking the Boss in the chin with the blade on my foot.",
                "Death by impalement.",
                "He twitches as I roll him to the side and rummage through his loot.",
                "\"Artwork? I can't sell that. Hard pass on food. Come on. Where are the cash, jewels, and precious metals? Gimme, gimme, gimme.\"",
                "There are several carriages' worth of spoils. And many dead merchants.",
                "I whisper to the corpses, \"I've avenged you. Now you can rest, knowing your treasures will be put to good use. I hope you make it to heaven.\"",
                "I gather my haul and pray in silence. I'm guessing I found about five million zeni. One zeni is more or less equal to one Japanese yen. All this will help fund my activities as a shadowbroker. You know, the world would be a much better place if it were overrun by criminals. Oh, how I wish life were like a video game and I could encounter enemies by walking down the street.",
                "\"Please wreak more havoc in your next life,\" I say to the Boss, giving him a thumbs-up, when I notice...something past my fingertip.",
                "\"Is that...a cage?\"",
                "It looks sturdy and pretty big.",
                "\"Did they have slaves? Eh, hard pass on anything I can't trade for cash.\"",
                "But what if there's something valuable inside? I lift its cover.",
                "\"Well, this is...unexpected.\"",
                "I'm not sure how to describe it, but this cage holds...a mound of rotting flesh. I can kinda tell it's human maybe, but no clue as to its age or gender.",
                "But it's alive. Wait, it might even be conscious. I peer into the cage, and the flesh jolts all of a sudden.",
                "I've heard of the Church executing these creatures. I think they're called the \"possessed.\" They're born as normal humans until their flesh rots out of nowhere, fated for death. But the Church goes out of its way to purchase them, executing them in the name of purification. They claim they're exorcising demons, but they're really just murdering the sick. But the ignorant masses applaud and praise them for keeping peace on earth. It's just as you'd expect from the Middle Ages. What a friggin' downer.",
                "I bet I'd get more zeni than this entire load of spoils if I were to sell this to the Church, but that's pointless to say since I can't sell it.",
                "Well, I guess I should put it out of its misery.",
                "I stick my slime sword into the cage...when I notice something else.",
                "Namely, this mound of flesh contains an abundance of magic. I've been training my magic since childhood, but this surpasses mine—it's honestly beastly. And this...",
                "\"Is this wavelength...the effects of a magical overload?\"",
                "I guess a magical overload must be the reason this turned into a pile of flesh. I've suffered its effects firsthand before. If I hadn't gotten it under control back then, I might've ended up suffering the same fate.",
                "I know magic has certain effects on the body, which I felt all too well that fated day. I could sense its potential to raise my tolerance for magic and allow me to handle more of it, but it would be too dangerous to induce a magical overload. I'd tossed the idea.",
                "But if I were to hypothetically conduct experiments on a product of this phenomenon...I can get closer to being a shadow commander without any risks.",
                "\"I can use this...,\" I say as I reach out to the flesh and infuse it with magic.",
                "Wow, it's been a whole month, huh...? I think as I recall my first encounter with the mound and heave a sigh, back in the same abandoned village.",
                "I wonder why things turned out this way.",

I mean, it wasn't my body, so I could go buck wild on it. I was plugging away at my little experiment, testing this and that. In all honesty, it was fun. After all, one of my greatest joys in life is sensing that I'm getting closer to the essence of magic and watching my power grow before my eyes.

                "\"Why? This can't be...!\"",
                "Illuminated by a single light streaming in from the outside, countless dead bodies litter the ground of the underground hall in the facility.",
                "Each bears a single slash—sliced by an unimaginably destructive force.",
                "\"Son of a bitch...!\"",
                "Grease glares at a group of figures dressed in black bodysuits. From their curves, he can guess they're petite girls—seven in total. Under the dim light of the moon, they're stealthy enough that it's easy to lose sight of them without a concerted effort. These women are using a rare technique to control their magical presence, and Grease recognizes this group might just rival him in strength.",
                "There's one who's drenched in blood, eyeing him under the moonlight.",
                "\"Nnr...!\"",
                "In this moment, instinct overtakes Grease—not for any explicit reason, but he can sense danger.",
                "Blood drips down her bodysuit and onto the floor, and she lets her katana drag behind her apathetically, creating a trail of gore.",
                "\"Who the hell are you? What's your purpose?\" he asks, attempting to suppress his unease.",
                "But he's faced with seven rivals as powerful as him. To fight would be asinine. Grease curses his bad luck as he searches for a way out.",
                "The blood-splattered girl isn't listening to him. She laughs, snickering from behind her bloodied mask.",
                "She's going to hunt me down...! Grease thinks, just as he hears another voice.",
                "\"Back off, Delta.\"",
                "The girl halts in place before retreating without resistance. Grease lets out a huge sigh of relief.",

                "He realizes she's revealed her face at some point, and her pale skin gleams under the moonlight. She steps forward.",
                "\"Nn...!\"",
                "He sees she's an elf with golden hair and beauty that leaves him gasping for breath.",
                "She takes another step.",
                "\"Our purpose...is to eliminate the Cult of Diablos.\"",
                "He doesn't take notice of her black sword until it slices through the air and parts the night sky. Or at least, it seems to create that illusion, and Grease is overcome with intimidation by the force of her swing and the wind that follows it.",
                "How did she acquire such power at this age? He trembles with jealousy and fear—but more than anything, he's petrified by her declaration.",
                "\"How...how do you know our group?\"",
                "The Cult of Diablos. Grease is one of the few people in the facility who knows the name of this organization.",
                "\"We know everything. We know all about Diablos the demon, his curse, and the heroes' descendants. And...the truth about the possessed.\"",
                "\"H-how did you...?\"",
                "Grease was only recently informed of this top secret information, which couldn't— No, shouldn't have been leaked.",
                "\"You're not the only ones after the Curse of Diablos.\"",
                "\"Ksh...!\"",

                "No, no good.",
                "Which means he needs to live—to survive to inform headquarters about the girls, which is why Grease moves forward.",
                "\"Aaaaaaaaagh!!\" he shouts, unsheathing his sword and swiping at Alpha.",
                "\"How reckless,\" she notes, dodging and countering it with ease.",
                "Her blade grazes his cheek, where blood pours from the fresh wound.",
                "And yet, that doesn't stop him. He continues to pursue victory, even as none of his attacks land. Grease misses by a hairbreadth each time.",
                "On the other side, Alpha is focused on eliminating unnecessary movements and calculating the trajectory of his sword to sidestep oncoming assaults.",
                "And all the while, Grease's arms are slashed, legs cut, shoulders sliced.",
                "But none of his wounds are fatal.",
                "Grease sneers when he realizes she won't kill him until she gets intel out of him, and a new path to victory comes into view. After he slices through nothing again and again, he's finally slashed in the chest, causing him to retreat.",
                "\"Let's not waste any more time,\" says Alpha.",
                "Grease doesn't answer, kneeling and clutching his wounded chest. A smile then spreads across his face...and he swallows something.",
                "\"What...are you doing?!\"",
                "His body doubles in size—his complexion darkens, his muscles bulge, his eyes glow red. And most importantly, his magic capacity increases...dramatically.",
                "\"Unnh...!\"",
                "Grease's steel sword zings through the air without warning, which Alpha manages to block instantly. But she grimaces on impact, using the momentum to leap back and create distance between them.",
                "\"Interesting trick,\" she notes, shaking her arm as pins and needles shoot through it. She cocks her head to the side. \"Based on the wave frequency, I'm guessing it's a magical overload...that's been forcibly induced...\"",
                "\"Lady Alpha, is everything all right?\" asks a voice from behind, surprised to see Alpha back down during a fight for the first time.",
                "\"It's fine, Beta. Just a messy situation... Hmm?\"",
                "When Alpha turns her gaze back to Grease, there's no one in sight. Well, more accurately, there's a rectangular hole in his place, leading to a lower level of the facility—a trapdoor.",
                "\"...He got away.\"",
                "\"Yeah...let's go after him,\" Beta responds, ready to leap in behind him.",
                "Alpha stops her in the nick of time. \"That won't be necessary. He'll take care of it.\"",
                "\"He...? Now that I think about it, Master Shadow said he'd go ahead of us... No way.\"",
                "\"Yeah. I have to admit I was worried he'd get lost when he sprinted down a different route.\" Alpha giggles.",
                "\"He knew this would happen... He's done it again.\"",
                "Their eyes glow with respect as they peer down the hole together.",
                "\"I'm lost,\" I mumble to myself in an empty underground facility.",
                "It was all fine and well when we infiltrated the hideout, but I got sick of fighting off small fry. I thought I'd go ahead and kill their boss, which brings us...here. Bummer. I mean, I even practiced what I'd say when I faced their leader and everything.",
                "Anyway, this place is huge. I get the vibe of a group of bandits living in an abandoned military facility.",
                "\"Hmm?\"",
                "I sense someone running toward me from the other side of the tunnel. It takes a few beats before the figure notices me, too, leaving a wide gap between us.",
                "\"You've been expecting me...,\" he assumes.",
                "He's super-jacked, and his eyes have a crimson glow for some reason or another. He looks...really friggin' cool. I can imagine him shooting laser beams with his eyes.",
                "\"But if it's just you, this should be a breeze,\" he remarks with a twisted smile on his face.",
                "Then he vanishes—well, more like moves fast enough that an average person would've thought he disappeared.",
                "But I parry his attack with one hand. As long as I can spot the course of the attack, I'm not scared by the velocity of the assault. Even power is all about how you use it.",
                "\"Nnr!\" he yelps.",
                "I push him away in the shoulder and retreat.",
                "His magic is incredible—much stronger than Alpha, if I'm being honest. But his command over it is dismal, unfortunately. He's nothing but a dope jacked with magic.",
                "I'm not a big fan of people who go bananas with their magic, getting yoked with spells and moving at unimaginable speeds, and I don't like relying on physical force. Not that I'm trying to reject it. I mean, if I was forced to choose between strength and technique, I'd take strength in a heartbeat, since advanced tactics without the power to back them up are useless.",
                "That said, I absolutely despise half-baked strategies that solely depend on physical abilities—like power alone, or speed alone, or reaction time alone. They overlook and disregard the subtleties of battle.",
                "You see, strength is natural, but mastery requires effort. Shadowbrokers never lose when it comes to skill and expertise. And I want to be the same. My techniques will bolster my strength. My ingenuity will dictate speed. My reaction time will let me scope out potential attacks. Physicality is important, but I'd never screw up a fight by relying on it. That's all part of my battle aesthetic.",
                "If I'm being honest, this hulky slugger is starting to piss me off.",
                "Let's teach him a lesson...about the right way to use magic.",
                "\"Lesson one.\"",
                "I wield my slime sword and walk forward—one step, two steps, three.",
                "On that last one, he takes a swing at me, which means I'm in his fighting range and is my cue to speed up. I take the tiniest quantity of magic possible, focus it in my feet, compress, and then release it in one shot. That's all there is to it, and you can create an explosive impact with the smallest magical force.",
                "His sword slices through the air.",
                "And now he's in my range.",
                "I don't need speed or power or magic. I graze his neck with my ebony katana, slicing through the topmost layer of skin and leaving the veins untouched.",
                "I back up. His blade scathes my cheek at the same time.",
                "\"Lesson two.\"",
                "I make my move as he readies his sword again. I don't use magic, letting his movements stay quicker than mine. But he can't attack and move at the same time—no matter his speed.",
                "Which is why I can get closer and take one tiny step.",
                "It's a distance that's too long for me and too short for him.",
                "There's a moment of silence that follows.",
                "I see him looking uncertain of his next move, but he ultimately chooses to back away.",
                "I knew he was going to do that, based on the shift of magical energy inside him, and I close the distance before he has a chance to back up.",
                "This time, my sword scrapes against his leg, cutting a little deeper than the last laceration.",
                "\"Gah...!\" He groans in pain and continues his retreat.",
                "I don't pursue him.",
                "\"Lesson three.\"",
                "I'm just getting started.",
                "Have I ever felt this overpowered before? Grease wonders as the ink-black sword continues to break skin.",
                "Even when he fought Alpha the elf, even when the princess claimed victory at the Bushin Festival, Grease didn't feel weak. In fact, the last time he'd felt a power imbalance...was when he was a kid. It was the first time he'd ever held a sword and squared off with his mentor—an adult versus a child, a champion versus a novice. It was hardly anything that could be considered a fight.",
                "Grease is experiencing that same feeling right about now.",
                "The boy in front of him doesn't look tough whatsoever. At the very least, he doesn't emit the same menacing aura as Alpha when Grease fought her. He's a total natural; his stance, magic, and swordsmanship all seem to come effortlessly. In fact, his strength and speed are unremarkable, honestly—nothing special at all. But his strategy perfects his swordplay. And he manages to stand against Grease's powers of mass destruction using that alone.",
                "Which makes Grease feel an overwhelming sense of defeat.",
                "He knows the only reason he's alive is because the boy allows it. If his opponent wanted it, Grease would be dead in an instant.",
                "But Grease could regenerate his body as long as he didn't suffer fatal wounds. Of course, there are limits and nasty side effects. Meanwhile, he's shed pails of blood and had his bones broken, his flesh shredded, which means he'll need more time to fully recover.",
                "But even in this time of crisis, Grease survives.",
                "No. It's more accurate to say he's been spared.",
                "Grease lets out a single question: \"Why...?\"",
                "Why are you letting me live?",
                "Why are we enemies?",
                "Why are you so strong?",
                "Why?",
                "The young boy shrouded in black looks down at Grease. \"Lurk in the darkness and hunt down shadows. That's the only reason we exist.\"",
                "There's a distant sadness to his voice.",
                "And that's all it takes for Grease to understand the situation.",
                "\"Are you going up against them...?\" he asks.",
                "There are certain people in this world who the law cannot touch. Grease knew this and considered himself above that threshold—special concessions, privileges, and those with hidden personas. After all, the light of the law doesn't shine to the very edge of the world.",
                "While Grease enjoyed certain privileges, he was trampled and crushed by those at the top, which made him yearn for more power...and led to his downfall.",
                "\"Even if you... Even if your gang of twats becomes stronger, you'll never defeat them. The darkness of this world...is a deeper abyss than your wildest dreams,\" he says—not to warn the boy but to express his diabolical hopes.",
                "Grease wants the boy to get pulverized, lose everything, and become totally disillusioned with society. But, overcome with petty envy and spite, he frets that this wish is out of reach.",
                "\"Then we dive deeper,\" offers the boy without a hint of eagerness or ambitiousness.",
                "But Grease can sense his steadfast resolve and unshakable confidence.",
                "\"It's not easy.\"",
                "Unacceptable.",
                "Utterly unacceptable, thinks Grease, who's doomed for attempting to take them down himself.",
                "This is the moment he decides to cross the final frontier. He removes a pill from his breast pocket and swallows it whole when he realizes he's not going to survive. If that's the case, he thinks, I'll use this life to teach him the truth.",
                "The truth about the darkness of this world.",
                "The aura surrounding Grease changes.",
                "Until now, his magical energy had been rampaging around his body, but it starts to withdraw, replaced by its densely compressed twin. His veins rupture and burst with blood, his muscles tear, his bones shatter—but his body heals instantly. He defies the physical limitations of a human form and hosts an immeasurable amount of magical power.",
                "The Cult calls this the \"awakening.\"",
                "Once one assumes this form, there's no turning back. But in return...one is bestowed with Herculean strength.",
                "\"Aaaaghhh!\" Grease roars in a beastly fashion before vanishing into thin air.",
                "The dull sound of impact hangs in the air. In the same moment, the boy in black is flung off his feet toward a wall, which he kicks to shift his body and land on the ground.",
                "But Grease continues swinging at him, propelling the boy back again.",
                "\"Too slow! Too flimsy! Too frail! This is reality!\" Grease aggressively hounds him.",
                "With another thump, the boy is catapulted backward by more of Grease's attacks—quick, heavy, and merciless. It's all because he possesses an overwhelming force.",
                "Grease thinks he has it all figured out: The tiger doesn't have to be cunning to kill a hare. He just needs strength. By pushing back, it makes it impossible for the boy to fight—and he's destined to fall apart.",
                "But this is all wrong.",
                "\"Hgh?!\" Grease whines as blood erupts from his chest.",
                "He takes notice of a laceration—one that breaks past the surface of his skin. Grease halts in place for a split second, but he recovers fast enough to knock his enemy back in the next instant.",
                "\"It's hopeless! You can't get me!!\" he shrieks, even as his flesh is shredded down to his bones.",
                "But his wounds begin to bubble up and heal in the next beat.",
                "\"This is true power! This is true strength!!\" Grease starts to accelerate, slashing his weapon through the air, even as blood spouts from his body.",
                "He appears as a flash of scarlet light.",
                "Ebony and crimson—the two colors clash, causing the one in black to get slung back and the one in red to spew fresh blood.",
                "Their battle is too quick for the human eye to catch, and the afterimage of crimson and the backward movements of ebony are the only indicators of something uncanny in the making.",
                "Their skirmish doesn't last long. There's a clear power imbalance, and it's easy to guess that the figure in black would be the one to break. It's a fight that the one in red shouldn't have lost—slinging his sword on repeat and pulverizing the other into submission with his cataclysmic strength.",
                "But why?",
                "Why does he look unfazed...?",
                "\"Why...why can't I hit you...?\"",
                "The boy in black hasn't changed from the beginning of the fight. He's barely unleashed any magic or moved on his own accord, instead choosing to go with the flow and let Grease fling him around. It's as if he's a fallen leaf swept away in a rapid stream.",
                "Except he's not completely passive. He uses the momentum of these blows to land a direct hit—without seeming showy or expending any unnecessary energy.",
                "It's natural. As if it's supposed to happen.",
                "\"Terrible,\" states the boy in black, staring down Grease and looking as if he can read his thoughts.",
                "\"You know nothing... Nothing, you bastard!\" Grease barks back, pooling every bit of magic into his body and sword before taking his shot.",
                "He's ready to eliminate this boy, even if it costs him his life, raring for the biggest assault of his existence.",
                "\"No more games.\"",
                "Grease is sliced in two—by an unconstrained swing of a sword. It's hurled down on him with the ease of a walk in the park. A singular stroke bisects it all—his sword, his enhanced magical powers, his muscular physique.",
                "The viscount thought the reason behind the boy's advanced swordplay was pure skill—not magic, strength, or speed. But he's wrong.",
                "\"What is this...?\"",
                "It's a single stroke that destroys everything.",
                "Grease watches the blade cut through his sword, his magic, his flesh, and his bones as he stands on the verge of death. It's a strike fortified with impenetrable magic, titanic strength, sonic speed, and most importantly...natural talent.",
                "It's perfect.",
                "The boy in black has everything at his disposal. But he chose not to use all of it until now.",
                "Nothing could withstand that single stroke containing every ounce of his power.",
                "\"I guess...this is it...,\" mutters Grease as blood rushes out of him, and his upper body topples and hits the ground. There's a beat before his other half crashes to the floor.",
                "Grease tries to regenerate the bisection, but nothing is salvageable. His flesh is putrid and rotten, excreting black fluid that soaks the area around him.",
                "Ebony looks down. Grease glances up.",
                "Having crossed swords with the boy in black, the viscount understands that one's temperament can be seen through one's swordplay. His opponent appears as a serious, naive nobody—who trained with blood, sweat, and tears to reign victorious in battle.",
                "I thought he was just a brat who knew nothing, but I was wrong.",
                "His enemy had known everything and had still chosen to fight.",
                "Powerless, he thinks of himself. He's been powerless for his entire life. He's tried to succeed but returned empty-handed, while this whelp in black...",
                "\"Mi...llia...\" Grease groans, reaching for a dagger encrusted with a blue jewel and closing his eyes.",
                "As consciousness slips away from him, he sees the smiling face of his beloved daughter who passed long ago.",
                "Anyway, that's how we ended our slaughter of some bandits—I mean, our little rescue mission.",
                "I found my sister totally unconscious, so I undid her chains and left her there, which contributed to her crankiness when she returned home the next day. But she's a real tough cookie—tough enough that the wound on her hand almost healed overnight.",
                "After a hectic week or so of hospital treatments and follow-up investigations, my sister finally made her way to the capital—though she pestered me more than usual during that time for some annoying reason.",
                "The girls in the Shadow Garden were busy, conducting their own research, taking care of the remaining bandits, and other stuff. Oh, right, we're not calling them bandits. Whatever. The Cult. I mean, they're all thieves in the end.",
                "But that geezer with red eyes was outstanding. I mean, he inspired me to come up with \"then we dive deeper,\" which sounds like something a shadowbroker would say. I owe him my thanks. I would've loved to have him play a supporting role to my part as an eminence in shadow.",
                "This was a must-see performance. My ability to improvise and portray a master puppeteer was off the rockers. It's a real shame there wasn't a live audience. But I only have to wait two more years—which is when I go to the capital. You know the one. It's a world-famous metropolis and the only city in this country that houses one million people.",
                "I bet protagonists are a dime a dozen, and there might be Final Bosses, too.",
                "There's bound to be conspiracies, rebellions, and incidents—none of which would ever happen in the boonies. And that's when the mastermind bursts onto the scene... Huh. Now that I think about it, I guess I'm just a toad who feels cocky about beating some bandits. At this moment in time, my prologue hasn't even been written.",
                "And then one day, Alpha and the other girls gather before me, just as I'm yearning to get stronger for school, which is two years down the line. They want to share their reports on the Cult and lab findings on the curse and all that jazz.",
                "It's unusual to have all seven of them in a room at once, especially since it seems they've got their hands full as of late.",
                "Geez, go easy on the research and investigations. I mean, it's all pointless anyway, I think as I listen to their reports.",
                "Here's a simple summary of their findings.",
                "Their first claim is that the heroes who slayed Diablos the demon were all women, which is why they're the ones who suffer exclusively from the curse.",
                "How creative. But I hate to break it to you that all the heroes were men in the most common theory. Oh, wait, I bet they came up with that since the Shadow Garden is comprised of seven women apart from me.",
                "Their next report was on how the curse was most common among elves, followed by hybrid beasts and then humans. According to their research, it has to do with the life spans of the respective species. With humans living short lives with weak traces of the heroic bloodline, they're least susceptible to the curse. On the other hand, elves have long life expectancies with potent concentrations of blood, which makes them the most prone to fall victim to the curse. The therianthropes, or hybrid beasts, are in the middle.",
                "Now that I think about it, I'm the only human in the Shadow Garden, and I've never been possessed. Besides me, we have two therianthropes and a posse of five elves—and all seven have been possessed. You know, they did a stellar job coming up with this backstory.",
                "And then they proceed to report on a bunch of other things, which I pretend to absorb.",
                "They move on to their reports about the Cult, which is supposedly a massive organization that operates on a global scale. Fascinating.",
                "In terms of being the possessed or cursed or whatever, they tell me the Cult calls them \"compatibles,\" and their members are supposedly going the extra mile to locate, acquire, and wipe them from existence or some crap.",
                "Anyway, they suggest that the Shadow Garden scatter across the world to prevent this from spreading. Their plan would leave me with one rotating subordinate, the rest of them scattering to every corner of the world to protect the possessed, investigate the Cult, and sabotage their activities.",
                "When they suggest this new plan, it hits me all of a sudden: They must have realized that the Cult doesn't exist.",
                "They're through with this stupid charade and demanding their freedom. What else could scattering across the world mean? I'm guessing they feel indebted to me for curing them, which is why they're going to stick with me on a rotating basis. I just have to deal with it. I know that's what they're trying to tell me.",
                "I'm bummed out. In my past life, the kids idolized the heroes as much as I adored masterminds—until we grew up, and they didn't even notice that they'd forgotten all about their precious heroes. I was left alone. I guess the girls have grown up, too.",
                "I'm feeling all soppy but agree to send them on their way. I never planned on having seven members to begin with. If they leave me with one subordinate, that's enough for me. I see them off, and we reluctantly exchange good-byes.",
                "I make a vow to myself: I'll never stop trying to become a mastermind, even if that means I have to face this world alone.",
                "She no longer fears killing others.",
                "Beta whips her inky katana, splattering congealed blood off her blade and onto the ashen ground in a clean line. She stands cloaked in the darkness of night and surrounded by a group of soldiers lying facedown.",
                "\"End him,\" orders Beta.",
                "The girls in black bodysuits pierce their blades into the guard. One of their hands in particular shakes violently, but it doesn't stop the girl from thrusting her sword into his pressure point.",
                "\"Guh... Gaaaah!\" shrieks the soldier with his final breath, causing her blade to freeze in place.",
                "It's the type of cry that'll haunt her in her sleep until she becomes accustomed to killing.",
                "Beta envelops the girl's hands on the helm with her own before giving the blade a sharp twist. Together, they feel the soldier's life leaving his body.",

                "She's raising them well.",

                "She still remembers how it felt when she killed for the first time—her sword piercing their heart, their hand grabbing hers. Beta couldn't believe the strength of their grip even as they suffered a fatal wound.",

                "After joining the Shadow Garden, she always followed Alpha around. After all, they were old acquaintances, and she knew she would go down the right path if she stuck by Alpha's side.",
                "But Beta couldn't find a reason to fight by following Alpha's footsteps—or understand the importance of finding said motivation. As a result, she couldn't get used to the idea of murder, vomiting violently after killing someone on a mission and shaking in fear every night as she tried to fall asleep. It wasn't unusual for her to wake up screaming in the middle of the night.",
                "On one particular evening, Shadow approached the tormented girl.",

                "What the heck?",
                "She wasn't sure how to respond—not that she was brave enough to oppose the one revered by Alpha—and shut her trap to listen to his story. It was more interesting than she'd initially imagined. In fact, she realized she'd been so absorbed in the tale that she'd forgotten the time.",
                "That evening, Beta had a deep, peaceful night's rest.",

Time flew by as she listened to them, and she'd be fast asleep in no time—and stopped jolting awake in the middle of the night. Her favorites were \"Cinderella\" and \"Snow White.\"",

Swiping the blood spatter off her cheek, Beta gazes at the night sky, where a full moon peeks out from between the clouds.

I've heard of others using magic to force their muscles to loosen up, but this still affects their performance.",

                "No. That's not it... This is normal for her. After all, the purpose of this activity is to review our strategies, meaning that speed and power are pointless. Alexia is focused on this goal—and that alone. I can tell by the way she handles her sword.",
                "This entire country sings the praises of Princess Iris, Alexia's older sister—brilliant and fiendish, the strongest combatant in the kingdom. On the other hand, they don't have much to say about Alexia. She possesses magic and forthright techniques, but she's inferior to her sister. That's what people generally say when talking about Alexia.",
                "But as I spar with her, I think she's good. She adheres to the basics and grasps the foundations of combat, though it feels uninspired.",
                "Yeah, it's run-of-the-mill. But that's the fruit of her labor: Her swordplay is polished, refined, and devoid of all excess. That's the proof that she's mastered the basics step-by-step.",

But Alexia hasn't spent all those days training with her head in the clouds. In her mission to become as strong as her sister, she's realized her own shortcomings and worked hard to make up for them.

                "I was suggesting they physically pummel the shit out of their enemy—which is the brutish method I find absolutely abhorrent. That's right; my core beliefs crumbled before this duo without pomp or circumstance. If I even think about that day, I get a headache. Yeah, let's not go there. Forget about it.",
                "\"Nice to see you again, my lord.\" Gamma gracefully walks toward me like a model on a runway.",

                "But I don't really mind. There are only two ways to react when a girl embarrasses herself: either pretend not to notice or go all out and tease her. Even though I'm in the former camp myself, there's something I have to say.",

                "My heart is pumping. I'm moved to the core. I cross my legs, rest my cheek in my left hand, and raise the other, focusing my blue-violet magic into my palm and shooting it into the heavens.",

                "While focusing their attention on my right hand, I snatched some coins in my left at top speed, stuffing them into my pocket before anyone could notice. Alpha or Delta might have picked up on it, but Gamma never stood a chance.",

                "Watching her is hilarious to me. She thinks I'm only borrowing one and a half million zeni, but I actually pocketed three million!",

She fell into an abyss of pain and fear and disappointment—and the one who rescued her was the boy who produced the blue-violet light. She would likely never forget that glow for her entire life. To Gamma, it represents the light of survival.",
                "Alpha once told Gamma there was life in it, and Gamma agreed, not for logical but for instinctual reasons.",
                "It didn't just heal external wounds—but a much deeper part of the soul. When she touched the bluish light, it was as if she was released from her shackles, liberated from something holding her back. She finally felt like she had reclaimed her identity.",
                "On that day, she was reborn. The moment she received the name Gamma, she vowed to devote her new life only to him.",
                "While her intentions were sincere, she was the least powerful member of the Seven Shadows. She was defeated and surpassed by newer members, left crawling on the ground and deeply humiliated. Somewhere along the way, Gamma realized she couldn't beat her peers. It didn't matter how hard she trained.",
                "She was in anguish. What was she worth? She would rather die than display her stupidity and bring everyone down. But he randomly called out to her the day she planned to end it all. And he imparted his Shadow Wisdom to her.",
                "That insight showed her how to fight with her intelligence over strength, and she dived headlong into his ways. And since she thought this was her only chance at survival, she literally put her life on the line to re-create his Shadow Wisdom.",
                "When Gamma looks back on it, she's certain he recognized her pain—that he shared his knowledge because he knew she was hurting and had foretold the path she would walk in life.",

                "For little did she know, everything she took for granted—her friends, family, life itself—rested atop a thin tower of ice. Nu was a happy child who didn't know what lurked underneath that fragile construct.",

                "Rose Oriana is stunned by the boy who keeps getting back up no matter how many times she knocks him down.",
                "He's soaked in blood, and no one can tell if he can lift up his sword. He doesn't look like he can fight— No, it's a miracle he can even stand.",
                "Although her sword is thin, her attack certainly isn't light. The tip of her blade may be blunt, but the magic inside of it is real. If she got one decent shot, he'd be rendered useless.",
                "But...exactly how many times has she hit him?",
                "It wasn't just once or twice. Even though he endured at least ten strikes, he still rises to his feet with unrelenting vigor.",
                "How is he still standing after all that? His body has exceeded its physical limits, but his eyes seem devoid of death.",
                "His fierce gaze tells her he still has something left to do.",
                "That's right. His soul surpasses the limitations of the body, and his unyielding soul is holding his broken being together.",
                "His valor leaves a deep impression on Rose. How badly does he want to win this battle and why? He must have a reason he can't allow himself to lose.",
                "There is an immense difference in skill. He doesn't have so much as a one-in-a-million chance, but even then, he refuses to give up.",
                "His fiery eyes glare at Rose.",
                "It isn't over yet. This isn't the end.",
                "Rose is moved that the tenacious spirit of a hero can defy death in the face of an undefeatable opponent. She has great respect for him, offering her deepest apologies for assuming it'd be an easy victory. He's certainly hopeless when it comes to a sword fight, but as for the battle of spirits, Rose has completely lost.",
                "\"You'll perish with my next attack.\"",
                "Which is why she chooses to end it quickly. If he keeps this up, he'll get up until he dies. That and...she didn't want to kill a promising young fighter.",
                "No one is cheering in the arena anymore. Everyone watches the boy in horror.",
                "Her sword reaches the apex of magic on this day. The sky quakes, and the people in the audience, concerned, mumble to one another.",
                "\"Looks like you're not giving up.\"",
                "His eyes burn brighter and brighter, not even slightly fearful of her oncoming attack but instead displaying an insatiable determination to fight.",

                "That was a close one.",
                "If anyone saw I was unscathed, it'd be a huge mess. Had I stayed any longer, I might've had to start taking swings at myself.",

                "\"Ooh, impressive. Considering you're working without magic.\"",
                "\"Magic isn't everything. If I'm fighting a weakling, I can easily dodge any attack.\"",

                "I can see all the faculty bound up by the auditorium, which is a massive hall that can easily fit all the students. It's where the school hosts its entrance ceremonies and the occasional lecture by a public figure or a theatrical performance.",
                "The Knight Order has gathered outside the campus in response to the commotion, but there's a clear threshold beyond which they aren't advancing. That could be the boundary of whatever's blocking everyone's magic. There didn't seem to be any students left in the school buildings, just men in black scrounging for anyone still hiding.",
                "I scoff as I look down at the school.",
                "I've always wanted to do this.",
                "I peer at the ravaged school, the shackled students, and the mysterious terrorist organization. I can cross this off my bucket list.",
                "Gaze down at the campus from the rooftop. Check.",
                "Well, I guess I'll have some fun before it gets dark. The truth is, I realized something when the men in jet-black barged into class.",

                "Imagine a light breeze, a clear blue sky, a sunny afternoon—and someone coming out onstage in a long black cloak. Who does that?",
                "Unheard of.",
                "They made one dire mistake. Right... They've underestimated the importance of TPO: There's a Time, Place, and Occasion for everything. If you don't adhere to it, fashion sense will be totally out of whack. Their disregard for TPO is tacky. I mean, black cloaks should only be worn at night.",
                "I'm planning on taking them out nice and slow; time isn't an issue. I would rather hold out and savor the fun.",
                "Which is why I'm going with the strategy Operation: Slow 'n' Steady Till Nightfall.",
                "I'm thinking all this as I observe the campus when I spot two men in black walking down the corridors. Yuck, wearing jet-black on a sunny day? Talk about uncool.",
                "Yeah...they make me want to play sniper.",
                "I slice off a thumb-size piece of slime from my suit. I roll it into a ball, infuse it with magic, lay it on the rooftop, and prepare to give it a good flick.",
                "\"You're in my line of fire, you dummies,\" I mutter to myself, then send it flying.",

                "With my slime bomb at the ready, I close one eye to scope out my next victim.",
                "In the school building across from me, I spot a defenseless blockhead.",

                "That's Sherry.",
                "What's she doing over there? She's giving herself away by blatantly looking back after each step.",
                "\"Sherry, you're blowing your cover.\"",
                "I confirm that a man in black is lunging at Sherry from behind. I lock onto my slime bomb target...and shoot.",

                "Ooh, I can't wait.",
                "Okay, here I go. I infuse my legs with magic and bound into the air when no one's looking.",
                "\"Yahoo!\"",
                "I safely land on the school building across the way. After that, I jump down, grab hold of a window ledge, and swing into the building. I glance around the hallway...and there she is.",

                "Just a moment ago, the knights said they couldn't use magic. If that's true, it would mean it has something to do with her, and she might know what caused it. And in terms of the artifact...",
                "Sherry hugs it tightly one more time.",
                "\"I've got to do something about this...!\"",
                "The image of the two knights bravely fighting to help her escape floats into her mind. She knows she can't let them die in vain.",

                "We open a thick door and walk in.",
                "There's a tasteful lounge in the center of the room and an entire wall stacked with oversized books. Files are piled high on a desk in the back. Sunlight gently pours in from the northern window. It's obviously a space for proper adults.",

                "But after significant consideration, I've decided to intervene as the savior type of background character. I'm an extra who will never act where others can see—never ever.",
                "\"Found it.\" Sherry comes back from the desk with a pile of documents, spreading them across the coffee table.",

                "\"This seems to control it. The Eye cannot move on its own; I believe it can only be used when attached to this device. When they act together, the artifact is no longer defective and is limited to storing magic short-term.\"",

                "\"Underground?\"",
                "\"Yes.\" Sherry takes a few books off the bookshelf, and it swings back to reveal a staircase leading to a lower level.",

There are three floors in the enormous, drafty auditorium, and all of the exits are guarded by men enshrouded in jet-black. The students are being monitored and not allowed to make a single peep.

                "But no one's there. He clucks his tongue in frustration.",
                "A single palm strike has broken the bones in his left arm, which he'd been protecting with magic. His heart might have shattered if he hadn't shielded himself when he did.",
                "Whish. Rex moves with the noise, tuning in to the presence behind him and swinging. His timing is perfect.",
                "The runt...is getting faster! How dare he! Rex takes stabs at the air behind the boy, quickly resuming his posture with the sole aim of protecting his heart.",
                "\"Agh...!\"",
                "He suffers a blow to the ribs.",

                "It's nearly impossible to detect the enemy, and countering is out of the question. Only he's taking damage. From an objective standpoint, there's no graver situation. But...Rex has a wealth of experience worming himself out from between a rock and a hard place.",
                "For he is Rex, a Named Child.",
                "\"That's a handy artifact you're using,\" Rex comments so his enemy can hear.",
                "He's figured out the enemy's shtick.",
                "It doesn't take him long to piece it together. His opponent moves faster than humanly possible, which means he requires extraordinary power to keep it up.",
                "\"At first glance, I have the disadvantage. But you can't fool me. You're pushing yourself, right?\"",
                "With inhuman speed comes sacrifice. He sees the traces of it already.",
                "\"Don't you know your uniform is covered in blood?\"",
                "Yes...Rex solved the riddle when he saw the red uniform: His opponent used the power of the artifact to achieve logic-defying speeds. And in exchange, it's wearing him down. It's clear from the rivers of blood pouring out of his enemy. The boy will reach his limit. If Rex can hold out until then...victory is his.",
                "That's Rex, the Game of Betrayal, the Named Child, who can completely expose his victims with minimal information.",
                "\"I'd guess that you have a few hits left. That's when you'll have reached your limit!\" Rex declares in a powerful voice.",
                "But his enemy doesn't reply. He's been silent and still ever since Rex started his little speech.",
                "\"Guess I've hit the nail on the head.\" The corners of Rex's lips form a sinister smile.",
                "He can see his victory. But...it's not as easy as Rex makes it out to be. In fact, he still has to evade the undetectable palm strike a few more times.",
                "\"Hey, why so silent?\" Rex starts feeling confident, refusing to show any sign of weakness.",
                "This battle is one of...intense psychological warfare.",
                "\"Come out, you chicken!\"",
                "Whoosh.",
                "Just as the sound rushes through the air, Rex evades the attack using only his instincts, twisting his upper body to avoid the trajectory of his hand.",
                "That fast?! He uses his right arm as a shield at the very last second.",
                "\"Gaaaah!!\"",
                "It snaps in every possible place. He backs away, retaining his grip on his sword through sheer determination.",
                "And yet, his opponent persists. Rex has only seen the enemy's most basic moves, and he's drawing near.",
                "In other words...this is the turning point in their battle.",
                "\"Come at meeeeeeeeee!!\" Rex shrieks as he protects his weak points.",
                "His enemy has reached his limit. If Rex can endure this final strike, victory is his.",

                "\"Kah-kah...!\" Clutching his stomach, he coughs up blood. His ribs tear his internal organs.",
                "But...he's alive. Guarding with all his might pays off.",

I supported her work and gathered artifacts for her, and she focused on her research, which I later used. She wasn't interested in fame or fortune, so we got along just fine. And then I stumbled upon the Eye of Avarice. It was the artifact for which I'd been searching. But you see, Lukreia...that stupid woman claimed it was unsafe, and she was about to request the nation store it for her. Which is why I killed her. After I cut her from her extremities inward, I impaled her heart and twisted my blade.\"",

All I had to do was set the stage to gather magic and prepare the perfect camouflage. Today...will be my greatest day, when all my dreams will come true.\"",

Of course, I had my life as a faceless extra to consider, so I made sure to take a three-minute shower every day, but I eliminated all time in the tub so I could train instead.",
                "This was around the point when I was pushing the limits of the human species, by the way. In other words, I had to make every minute count. I mean, this was during the period when I was seriously planning on repelling nukes with my right straight-hand punch.",
                "When I finally realized I was losing my mind, I went back to bathing. The trigger for that was a hot spring. Hot water fosters composure in the soul, which has a direct effect on my training. That was the reason I could do the mental gymnastics to realize I needed to find magic or vibrational auras.",

                "Afterward, we tacitly agree on a policy of mutual nonintervention and go on pretending the other doesn't exist. The spring is designed for nobility, which means few people use it, especially early in the day. That's why all the dividers were cleared away, opening it up for mixed bathing. It's spacious. Everything below eye level is covered by the steam, and the sun is starting to rise. It would have been perfect if I had this all to myself. I bask in the water and the morning sunlight.",
                "Alexia and I are on opposite ends of the outdoor bath with the best view, watching the sun rise in uncomfortable silence.",

                "She's sitting in one of the seats for the special guests, waiting for the opening ceremony of the Goddess's Trial to begin. The seats in question are occupied by Natsume, Alexia, and Rose. There are a number of other guests behind them, but they're the main attractions. It's painfully obvious they're being used to draw an audience as de facto booth babes, but she can overlook that.",
                "There are two things Alexia finds disagreeable.",
                "The first is Nelson. The acting archbishop is busy pompously greeting everyone in the center of the grounds. When she talked with him earlier about the archbishop's murder the day before, he obstinately refused to let her look into the incident.",
                "It all started when Nelson spouted some nonsense about the inspection being called off because the subject was dead. Alexia had replied that made the investigation all the more necessary, dumbass, though she'd obviously used more diplomatic language. Nelson insisted she needed to get her request reapproved if she wanted to conduct an inspection.",
                "Even if she hurried, it would take her three days to get back to the capital, at least a week to get approval, and another three days to return to Lindwurm. Who knows how long it would take Nelson to accept her permit once she actually brought it to him? Depending on his mood, he could easily end up making her wait an additional week. It went without saying that after all that time passed, crucial evidence could be lost forever.",
                "That said, Alexia knew she was acting as a representative of her country, so she couldn't exactly force his hand. Holy Teachings wasn't just practiced in the kingdom of Midgar but in all the nearby nations, too. If she tried to push the issue, she was liable to receive backlash from their neighbors, not to mention lose the support of the populace. Religion made for a handy ally, but as a foe, it was an absolute nuisance.",
                "She glares at Acting Archbishop Nelson as he jovially continues giving his address. At least grieve a little, baldy, she silently mutters to herself. The archbishop's death hasn't been reported to the public, but still. Oh, and by the way, Nelson is bald.",
                "Alexia sighs, then glances at the woman in her periphery, Natsume or whatever, sitting to her left.",
                "Natsume is the other thing that irks Alexia.",
                "Natsume sits politely beside her, responding to the crowd's cheers with a broad smile. Her elegant silver hair frames her blue feline eyes and accompanying mole, and her features only serve to enhance her likability.",
                "Thanks to her pearly smile and queenly wave, her lovely appearance, and her graceful conduct, she's wildly popular.",
                "As Alexia looks at her, she becomes more and more certain there's something fishy about her.",
                "Maybe Natsume is the kind of genius author who comes around once in a millennium and maybe she isn't, but the fact of the matter is that Alexia hadn't so much as heard of her prior to that day. True, Alexia doesn't have a shred of interest in literature, but as a princess, she does put some effort into knowing who's who. In other words, Natsume must have only just risen to prominence recently.",
                "For a rookie to have such presence, to conduct herself so well, and to be so popular? That is fishy.",
                "She isn't jealous! If anything, it's the kind of hate that arises from being cut from the same cloth.",
                "Alexia knows how to conduct herself flawlessly in front of the public. She lives her life repressing her true self and playing the part of a perfect princess. Most people in positions of power are playing a role in some capacity, but it's hard to come by someone willing to sacrifice themselves to perform the part to perfection. It's a safe bet to say that the more an actor sacrifices to pull off the ultimate performance, the darker their underside.",
                "\"Thank you all,\" Natsume calls out to the crowd. Alexia clicks her tongue.",
                "She finds that soft, ingratiating voice of Natsume's grating. Her exposed chest is too calculated as she stoops over to show off her cleavage... Well, aren't you just the cutest?",
                "As she internally bad-mouths Natsume, Alexia waves at the gathered masses with an unchanging smile.",
                "However, the crowd clearly reacted to Natsume better. For a moment, Alexia's cheek twitches, and she crosses her arms. As she uses them to push up her breasts, she hunches over. Just a little.",
                "The crowd's cheers grow ever so slightly louder.",
                "Emphasis on ever so slightly.",
                "W-well, my neckline isn't very low, so it's hardly my fault, Alexia silently reassures herself as she returns to her seat.",
                "She casts a fleeting glance to her right, where Rose is smiling happily. She's been like that all morning.",
                "Then, just in case, the princess glances to her left.",
                "In that moment, she sees something: the corners of Natsume's lips curled up in a mocking smirk.",
                "Something inside Alexia snaps.",
                "How disagreeable, Beta silently mutters to herself as she plays the role of Natsume the novelist.",
                "There is just one thing she finds annoying, and it's sitting to her right: Alexia Midgar. She's the vermin who used her position as a princess and a friend to get close to Beta's beloved master.",
                "Everything is fishy about that woman, behaving like a model princess by cajoling the crowd with her sickeningly soft, ingratiating voice and waving at them with that questionable smile. When it comes to women who pretend to be perfect as a matter of habit, it's generally a safe bet they have a dark underside. There isn't a doubt in Beta's mind that her master would never fall for such a wench, but even a one-in-a-million chance is still a chance.",
                "And even if that didn't end up being a problem, the woman was still a nuisance, one whose presence was most unwelcome in the pages of Beta's The Chronicles of Master Shadow.",
                "When Beta heard Shadow saved that woman during The Case of the Kidnapped Princess, her blood boiled. It filled her with rage that she hadn't been the one who'd...er, wait, uh...at the fact that girl had caused so much trouble for her master. Right. It wasn't jealousy, obviously!",
                "In order to contain her fury, Beta rewrote that section, replacing the role of the victim saved by Shadow with an adorable silver-haired, blue-eyed elf with a beauty mark. She stayed up late at night reading and rereading that section over and over.",
                "But now, the harlot was threatening to barge in on The Chronicles of Master Shadow again. Beta was more powerful, more beautiful, and more devoted to her master, so what did that woman think she was doing butting in? I-it was ridiculous!",
                "As Beta internally spews vitriol at that vulgar princess, she responds to the crowd's cheers on autopilot.",
                "When she snatches a glance to the side, she sees, of all things, that tawdry princess trying to push up her shoddy chest to curry favor with the masses.",
                "How sickening.",
                "And besides, those things don't come close to hers in terms of volume. They're totally average.",
                "Thoroughly pleased at herself for emerging victorious yet again, Beta glances down at her voluminous cleavage and lets out a little snort.",
                "Oops. Did Alexia hear that?",
                "Beta turns away to play dumb, which is exactly when a sharp pain shoots through her right foot.",
                "\"Ah...?!\" She stifles her yelp and looks down to discover Alexia's heel being driven into her foot.",
                "As she strains to keep herself from snapping, Beta calmly addresses her.",
                "\"Excuse me, Princess Alexia, but would you please move your foot?\"",
                "Alexia stares fixedly at Beta as she removes her heel, feigning that she only just realized what she was doing. Then, without so much as an apology, she even has the nerve to let out a little laugh.",
                "You absolute piece of shiiiit!! Beta is about to scream out loud, but between her devotion to her master and her loyalty to the Shadow Garden, she manages to rein herself in.",
                "Only barely.",
                "A drop of blood trickles from Beta's lip.",
                "Rose just keeps on happily smiling.",
                "I gaze out vacantly over the Goddess's Trial from the stands.",
                "It's the middle of the day, so things have only just gotten started. They're still giving speeches, introducing the guests, and marching in the parade. The main event, the actual Trial, isn't slated to start until after sundown.",
                "Currently, I'm just in the bleachers as another face in the crowd. I let out a sigh, looking at the three girls all getting along in the guest box.",
                "I wanna do something.",
                "Specifically, something shadowbrokery. Resigning myself to the role of a normal spectator during an awesome event is killing me.",
                "Like, I should be partaking in that standard trope where I participate in the Trial myself while keeping my identity hidden or something.",
                "You know, the bit where I make some huge display of my powers, and everyone goes, Who is that guy?!",
                "If this were a tournament, that would be sweet. Unfortunately, though, everyone only gets one round here, and after some research, I found out it'd be pretty hard to nab a slot while keeping my identity under wraps. I consider barging in by force, but I figure I'd rather save that for something more important.",
                "As I wrestle with one nonstarter of an idea after another, the event gradually proceeds.",
                "Sometimes that's just how it goes. I couldn't think of a decent plan yesterday, and it's not like I was expecting some convenient stroke of genius to strike me on the spot. And even though it sorta feels like I'm giving up, I'll still be able to enjoy myself in the normie way. This world is short on big events, so I find myself able to have a surprisingly good time. I even manage to gamble my way into a little pocket money.",
                "Eventually, the sun makes its way down, and the main attraction finally starts. A brilliant light fills the grounds, and ancient letters rise up from the ground in the arena.",
                "Then the letters release a dome of white light. The crowd goes wild.",
                "Once the challenger goes into the dome, the Sanctuary picks out an appropriate opponent, and the battle starts. That's it. No one in the wings is able to interfere until one side or the other is unable to continue. Apparently, people have even died.",
                "The whole bit about being forced to fight until one party literally can't anymore makes me reevaluate the merits of playing a background character through this event. There is a real risk that my true strength could be discovered if I enter.",
                "Meanwhile, the first challenger steps into the dome after the introductions. He's some sort of tough guy from the Knight Order.",
                "But the dome offers no response.",
                "The man curses as he leaves the arena.",
                "You can't blame the guy: The entrance fee is one hundred thousand zeni, after all. And apparently, there are over 150 participants this year.",
                "It makes sense in a way. Passing the Goddess's Trial is supposedly a great honor. You get a commemorative medal, and I hear everyone falls all over themselves going, You beat the Goddess's Trial? Wow! Here's a job! to the victor.",
                "As I watch the challengers go up one by one, I find myself wondering just how long it's gonna be until Alpha's turn.",
                "The first ancient warrior who shows up to fight is for lucky challenger number fourteen.",
                "Annerose is a traveler from Velgalta, a country that prizes swordplay, and when she enters the dome, the ancient script reacts and begins glowing. The light coalesces into a humanoid shape—a translucent warrior. According to the commentators, he's Borg, a warrior from ancient times.",
                "The two of them have a fairly ordinary battle, and Annerose secures a fairly ordinary victory. I was pretty pumped up to see what the ancient warriors could do, so I'm bummed at how mundane the fight turns out. Fingers crossed that the next ones will be stronger.",
                "As the event goes on, it dawns on me that I had it wrong. Annerose herself is strong. Eight warriors have been summoned at this point, but she's the only challenger who's won so far. When I think about it like that, I realize Borg must've been a tough nut, too.",
                "The night wears on, and the pool of remaining challengers is reduced to a mere few.",
                "As I feel the event starting to wind down to its conclusion, I hear the name of the next contestant get called out.",
                "\"Our next challenger is from the Midgar Academy for Dark Knights: Cid Kagenou!\"",
                "Cid Kagenou? Who's that? Wait... That's me!",
                "I'm definitely the only Cid Kagenou who goes to the Midgar Academy for Dark Knights, but...I definitely don't remember signing up.",
                "\"Let's give our brave contender a warm welcome!\"",
                "No! Stop! Pause!",
                "A wave of applause washes over me. Someone even whistles, and excited cheers fill the stadium.",
                "I'm not liking the vibe here. My cheek twitches as I rack my brain.",
                "Given the situation, I have three options.",
                "Option one: I can give up and go fight. If nothing happens, my position as a nobody is safe, but if some superpowerful warrior appears, I'm at risk of having my powers discovered.",
                "Option two: I can make a run for it. I'm just some rando from the Academy for Dark Knights, after all. Nobody knows what I look like, so it would be a breeze. Unfortunately, I'd piss off the Church. If they complain to my school, I might even get expelled.",
                "Option three: I can cause a shitstorm. Looks like this is my only choice.",
                "I erase my presence, dashing at top speed to find a hiding place. Once I've made sure I'm alone, I transform into my Shadow guise and leap out into the air.",
                "I'm a fervent believer in the philosophy that there's no problem you can't get rid of with an explosion.",
                "And on that note...",
                "Commence Operation: A Mysterious Badass Causes a Shitstorm!",
                "As I land atop the domed platform, my long coat flutters behind me.",

                "The crowd stirs.",
                "\"Ancient memories slumber within the Sanctuary...\"",
                "The ancient script reacts and begins forming a humanoid shape.",
                "\"And tonight, we shall release them...\"",
                "I draw my ebony katana and slice through the night sky.",
                "Over in the guest seats, Beta's mouth is open impressively wide.",
                "\"Shadow!!\"",
                "\"Shadow?!\"",
                "\"Mas—?!\"",
                "Realizing she's about to call him Master Shadow, Beta frantically stops herself mid-sentence.",
                "Fortunately for her, everyone else in the guest box has their eyes glued to Shadow, so nobody hears her. Alexia, Rose, and even Acting Archbishop Nelson are visibly shaken at the appearance of a sudden intruder.",
                "As she closes her gaping mouth, Beta begins thinking. This wasn't part of the plan.",
                "At the same time, though, she realizes something. She knows her beloved master would never take such measures without good cause. There must be some key reason for his actions, and it's her job as his backup to figure out what it is.",
                "A moment later, Beta is calm and collected again.",
                "What should she do?",
                "What's the best course?",
                "\"I see. So that's Shadow,\" murmurs Nelson. \"I don't know what he's trying to do, but the Church's paladins are stationed all around the arena. You've overestimated yourself, fool. We won't let you escape.\"",
                "Nelson gives the order for the paladins to assemble.",
                "These are knights chosen from baptism to protect the Church. Normal knights can't even begin to compare to their strength. Back when she was a kid, Beta found herself struggling to take one down in the process of saving a \"Compatible.\" Nowadays, of course, she would never let something so unseemly happen.",
                "\"Why is Shadow here...?\" mutters Alexia.",
                "\"Is he okay? I hope he doesn't get needlessly caught up in all this...,\" says Rose. Keeping one eye on Shadow, she restlessly surveys the area.",
                "Suddenly, the arena is flooded in white.",
                "The ancient letters flash, then coalesce into the shape of a warrior.",

                "\"Aurora the Calamity Witch...\"",
                "\"Aurora? Impossible...\"",
                "Beta's and Nelson's voices overlap.",
                "When the light dies down, a woman stands in its place. Her hair is long and black, and her eyes are a vivid shade of violet. She wears a thin black robe, and her dark-purple dress and pale skin are almost translucent. She has an artistic beauty to her, as though she were a sculpture come to life.",
                "\"Aurora? Who's that?\" Alexia asks Nelson, deliberately ignoring Beta.",
                "\"She's the Calamity Witch. Long ago, she rained chaos and destruction down on our world.\"",
                "\"The Calamity Witch... I've never heard of her.\"",
                "\"Neither have I. Miss Natsume, you suggested that you had?\" asks Rose.",
                "\"Yes, but little more than her name alone,\" replies Beta.",
                "Which was the truth.",
                "Aurora the Calamity Witch. Each time Beta finds out more about ancient history, Aurora's name invariably shows up. Even so, she still has no idea what kind of chaos Aurora sowed or the destruction she wrought. Other than the mysteries surrounding Diablos, her history is the one the Shadow Garden is putting the most effort into researching.",
                "And now, she's here in person. This is a massive breakthrough. Beta withdraws her notepad from the gap in her cleavage, then jots down a hasty sketch of Aurora. Then she sketches Shadow squaring off against her. She spends considerably more time on the latter.",
                "\"Gathering ideas for your novels?\" Rose comments.",
                "\"...Something along those lines.\"",
                "After scribbling \"Master Shadow was just as sublime as always,\" Beta snaps her notepad closed.",
                "\"If you wouldn't mind, could you tell me a little more about Aurora?\" asks Beta flirtatiously.",
                "Nelson swells with pride. \"I can hardly blame you two for your ignorance. In fact, I'm more surprised that Miss Natsume had heard about her. Only a small fraction of people are familiar with Aurora, even among the Church,\" he says with a smile. His gaze never leaves the cleavage peeking out from Beta's blouse. \"Still, it looks like we won't need those paladins after all. Shadow's luck appears to have run out.\"",
                "\"Is Aurora really that strong?\" asks Rose.",
                "\"She's the most powerful woman in recorded history. She could crush someone like him with one hand tied behind her back. Sadly, though, that's as much as I can tell you.\"",
                "Nelson goes quiet, as if to say See for yourselves.",
                "Beta becomes indignant—there's no doubt in her mind her lord will emerge victorious, but that's not to say she's completely free of worry.",
                "Aurora the Calamity Witch was resilient enough to etch her name in the annals of history. If the battle against this foe tires her master out, the paladins might take advantage of that opportunity and...",
                "It's unthinkable...but not impossible.",
                "Plus, enough time has passed for Beta to get a dim idea of Shadow's plan. He mentioned something about releasing ancient memories slumbering in the Sanctuary. He'd taken action to call forth Aurora. There must be some sort of merit in doing so.",
                "If her master has judged Aurora to be the key to all this, then Beta intends to follow his lead.",
                "Beta gently touches the beauty mark on her cheek. That's the signal that indicates a change in plans. Lurking somewhere in the area, Epsilon has probably picked up on her cue. Even if she hasn't, Beta is confident Epsilon will act appropriately.",
                "\"It's about to begin.\"",
                "Prompted by Nelson, Beta turns her gaze toward the arena. There, she sees Shadow with his ebony katana in hand and Aurora with arms crossed and a relaxed smile. It makes her seem so alive and beautiful, it's hard to believe Aurora is composed of nothing but distant memories.",
                "\"I find it hard to believe Shadow would go down so easily...,\" whispers Alexia. Her expression is serious, and she's watching Shadow closely.",
                "Beta finds herself ever so slightly impressed. At least Alexia isn't totally blind.",
                "The air in the stadium is tense. The silence is stifling.",
                "Shadow. Aurora. They continue standing there, staring at each other.",
                "Maybe this moment is critical for them. Maybe they're each trying to get a read on the other.",
                "Finally, with an air of seeming reluctance, the battle begins.",
                "I haven't felt this way in a really long time.",
                "As I stand facing the woman with violet eyes, I grin beneath my mask.",
                "She's smiling, too.",
                "There's no doubt in my mind that she feels the same as I do.",
                "In my opinion, each battle is a conversation.",
                "A tremor in their sword's tip, a shift in their gaze, the position of the feet... There's meaning to be found in all those tiny things, and seeking those meanings and figuring out how best to deal with them are what fights are all about.",
                "It's no exaggeration to say that the most skilled in combat hold the power to perceive purpose in the smallest of actions and prepare a superior response.",
                "That's why I think of it as a conversation.",
                "With stronger communication skills, you can anticipate further ahead, allowing you to respond appropriately, which they can guess before you can follow through and react, and so on and so forth, in an endless exchange.",
                "On the other hand, if your conversational skills are lacking, or if there's too big a difference between you and the other guy, you won't be able to get a dialogue started in the first place.",
                "One side, or sometimes even both, will act on impulse until the fight ends.",
                "That's no conversation. It's not even a process. Just a result. In my opinion, if you aren't planning on having a discussion, you might as well just go ahead and decide your fight with a good old game of rock-paper-scissors. Delta, I'm talking to you here. Her rules let rock beat the living shit out of paper and scissors.",
                "That said, I'm hardly in any position to talk. It's been forever since I've had anything even resembling a conversation.",
                "Unlike Delta, though, I do at least go in trying to communicate... It just always ends with me playing rock and smashing in their face.",
                "That's why this chick is getting me more excited than I've been in a while. She's watching me. The tip of my sword, my gaze, my footwork... While she pretends to smile nonchalantly, she's watching every meaningful move I make.",
                "I think I'll call her Violet. My dear, beloved Violet.",
                "For the first few moments, our conversation consists of merely staring at each other.",
                "Bit by bit, we're learning. She's the type who likes to keep her distance, and I'm fundamentally the kind of guy who likes to match my opponent's rhythm. I'm definitely not the type who likes smashing people with my rock.",
                "And because of that, I begin our conversation by ceding the initiative.",
                "After you, I imply.",
                "The very next moment, I yank back my front leg.",
                "As I do, something like a red spear explodes from the ground where my foot was.",
                "I retreat half a step. Gotta say I wasn't expecting her first move to come from below me.",
                "The red spear splits into two, rushing at me from both sides.",
                "The first step is to observe.",
                "I want to judge its speed, mobility, and destructive capacity.",
                "For these reasons, I dodge the spear on my left, then block the one on my right with my katana. The impact has weight to it. It's definitely enough to kill me.",
                "The dodged spear proceeds to split again. There are probably a thousand red wires now, and they all look sharp as needles.",
                "Then, they converge on my position.",
                "I gather magic in my blade and sweep the lot of them away, obliterating the red spear completely.",
                "\"A swarm of mosquitoes can never take down a lion,\" I tell her.",
                "Violet beams with grace. We go back to staring at each other for a bit.",
                "With stronger communication skills, it takes less time to gauge the other party, including their condition for the most part.",
                "I know how this battle will end. Violet probably does, too.",
                "Suddenly, the silence is broken when a series of spears as thick as logs burst out of the ground.",
                "There are nine of them in total.",
                "I'm able to dodge the wide ones, but they can change their shape like tentacles and keep coming—trying to stab at me with spears, wrap around me with string, chomp at me like jaws.",
                "That's the way she likes to fight: a lethal, one-sided game with those shape-shifting tentacles.",
                "I continue observing. As I watch how the feelers operate, I refine my movements.",
                "By doing so, I'm able to remove any unnecessary motion when I dodge. Full steps turn to half steps. Two moves turn to one.",
                "Even if I avoid them forever, I can't win, but evasion is a necessary first step to counterattacking.",
                "The less I have to move to dodge, the faster my subsequent counterattack can come.",
                "Eventually, my evasion and my counterattack will coincide.",
                "With a single step, I bring myself directly in front of Violet.",
                "At some point, a scythe appears in her hands. It cleaves toward me.",
                "As I repel the blow with my katana, I kick her in the leg.",
                "A slime sword extends from the tip of my foot and impales her. As of late, I've mostly been using it as a prop for when I want to get theatrical, but it's invaluable against strong enemies as a way to throw them off-balance.",
                "For a beat, she stops moving, and a moment is all I need.",
                "Violet smiles, accepting the outcome.",
                "\"I wanted to fight you at your full strength.\"",
                "As fresh blood sprays through the air, I whisper in a low voice only Violet can hear.",
                "\"Like I said, Shadow doesn't have a leg to stand on,\" says Nelson proudly. Alexia ignores him.",
                "Since the beginning of the battle, Aurora has been pushing Shadow back nonstop. Alexia gazes in astonishment at the terrifying speed of the red tendrils.",
                "Those things are unlike any weapon she's ever seen. They change their form so freely, it's like they're an extension of Aurora's own body. She could probably even extend them out even farther and run an entire group through at once.",
                "Anyone insisting on fighting her with a sword would be doomed from the get-go.",
                "So this is the power of ancient battle techniques. Alexia is forced to admit she would be no match for Aurora.",
                "\"He's more persistent than I expected, but the difference in skill is clear.\"",
                "You're wrong. Alexia silently rejects Nelson's observation.",
                "Although it may look like Shadow is being pushed back by Aurora's onslaught, he hasn't actually tried to attack yet. He's just observing, taking stock of this unfamiliar attack.",
                "Aurora is strong, make no mistake. She's powerful enough to give Shadow a decent fight, after all.",
                "But those red spears haven't so much as touched him yet.",
                "\"A swarm of mosquitoes can never take down a lion.\"",
                "As Shadow speaks, he blasts away over a thousand slender spikes in a single blow.",
                "The red spears regroup into thick poles and rush at Shadow from all directions.",
                "They hum through the air as they rain down on him with enough force to kill a lion, splitting apart and gnashing at him like fangs.",
                "But they just can't connect.",
                "Much to the contrary—with each pass, Shadow's evasions get smoother.",
                "Each time it seems they can't possibly get any more efficient, they do.",
                "Each moment, Alexia thinks the battle has reached its apex, only for it to be overwritten with an even loftier summit the next.",
                "\"Amazing...\"",
                "\"As always...\"",
                "Alexia and Natsume whisper in unison.",
                "The truly strong are able to drive their opponents into a deadlock with defense alone. Alexia's instructor taught her that once.",
                "This fight is a prime example.",
                "\"What are you doing, you stupid witch? Finish him off already!\" Nelson screams in a tone tinged with irritation.",
                "But the moment has passed.",
                "Aurora is no longer capable of stopping Shadow.",
                "The fight was decided in the blink of an eye.",
                "Alexia was only able to make out a fraction of the exchange.",
                "Shadow stepped in, Aurora swung her scythe, and before Alexia knew it, there was blood everywhere.",
                "And the one who'd gone down...was Aurora.",
                "The result was quick and unsatisfying. It was like watching a lion snap a lamb's neck.",
                "Nobody could tell what Shadow had done or what happened in that final exchange.",
                "That was why it was so disappointing.",
                "The stadium is dead silent, as if that fierce fight never happened.",
                "\"Did she...just lose? That's impossible! She was on the attack!\" yelps Nelson.",
                "He probably thought Aurora was the favorite up until the very last moment.",
                "When the tables turn in the space of a single instant, it takes a minute for people to process the situation. Nelson isn't alone in that. Most of the spectators still aren't sure they haven't mistaken the defeated for the victor.",
                "\"What just happened? There's no way Aurora could lose! She's...!\"",

                "The confused paladins rouse themselves into motion and scramble after Shadow.",
                "Alexia suddenly realizes she's been holding her breath. As she exhales, she tries to memorize Shadow's sword work so as not to forget it.",
                "\"His tricks are as astounding as always...\" Rose's voice escapes her like a sigh.",

                "\"What is that...?\" whispers Rose. \"Is it opening...?\"",
                "It is. Slowly but surely, the door opens, glowing dimly as it does.",
                "It makes for a rather strange sight.",
                "\"Impossible... Did the Sanctuary respond?\" murmurs Nelson, audibly flabbergasted.",
                "\"What do you mean by that?\" asks Rose",
                "\"As you're aware, today is the one day a year that the door to the Sanctuary opens.\"",

                "\"True, there is one in the church. But it isn't the only one. Depending on who comes knocking, there are multiple doors the Sanctuary can send to receive them. The Unsolicited Door, the Beckoning Door, the Welcoming Door... And until we go in, there's no telling which one it is,\" replies Nelson. His gaze is fixed on the white portal. \"Now that things have come to this, we cannot allow the Goddess's Trial to continue. Remove the spectators from the grounds.\"",
                "Upon receiving Nelson's orders, the officials begin directing the audience outside. The special guests begin leaving as well.",
                "All the while, the door continues to open.",
                "\"Don't let anyone near it!\" barks Nelson. Once the door is open wide enough for a person to fit through, he calls out to Rose and the others. \"Please evacuate the premises.\"",
                "As he does, Rose draws her sword. Alexia does the same, and the two stand back-to-back as they ready their blades.",
                "\"What are you...?!\" cries Nelson, flustered. When he looks around, he discovers a group of people clad all in black have already surrounded them. Even Rose and Alexia only notice a moment before Nelson does.",
                "A clear, sonorous voice rings out. \"Sorry. I'm going to have to ask that you all remain there until the door fully closes.\" The speaker is a woman whose garb is noticeably different from the others'.",
                "\"You... Are you from the damn Shadow Garden?!\"",
                "In her dress-like robe, the woman steps forward from her comrades in black bodysuits and strides gracefully toward the door.",
                "For a moment, her gaze lights upon Rose and Alexia.",
                "Their shoulders shiver, and their spines freeze up, locking them together.",
                "She's strong...!",
                "Her gaze carries with it a terrifying intensity, and her presence is so overwhelming, it feels as if she commands the very night.",
                "Rose and Alexia both consider Shadow to be pushing the limits of strength, but this woman has reached at least his footing. That much they know.",
                "\"Epsilon, I leave the rest to you. And as for the two princesses, be good.\"",
                "\"Understood, Alpha.\"",

                "\"And what do you intend to gain from all this?\" asks Alexia.",
                "\"All we want from you is to stand down until the door disappears. Acting Archbishop Nelson will be coming with us,\" replies the curvy woman named Epsilon.",
                "Hearing his name, Nelson begins panicking. \"What are you people planning to do to the Sanctuary?\"",
                "\"It's not a question of what we're planning on doing but what we expect to find. Do as we say, and nobody needs to get hurt.\" Epsilon holds Rose and Alexia at bay with her gaze alone. Her eyes are like still lakes, and they're focused vigilantly on the two of them.",
                "She's strong, too. Not to the same extent as Alpha, but she has that intensity to her that only the powerful possess.",
                "That said, if it came down to it...",
                "\"If you so much as move, what happens to her will be on your heads.\" Epsilon clearly senses their hostility. She's looking straight at Natsume, who's been captured by one of the women in black.",
                "\"I-I'm so sorry...\" Natsume casts her gaze down apologetically.",
                "\"Miss Natsume...!!\"",

                "Their ability to fight back has been neutralized...or so she thinks.",
                "\"We could just abandon her,\" suggests Alexia quietly enough that only Rose can hear.",
                "\"Absolutely not.\" Rose's veto is firm.",

                "\"Absolutely not, I said.\"",
                "As the two of them argue back and forth, the door to the Sanctuary stops opening. This time, it's swinging shut.",
                "Slowly but surely, it closes.",
                "The group in black enter the door one after another, dragging Natsume and Acting Archbishop Nelson along with them.",
                "Rose and Alexia can do nothing but stand by and watch.",
                "Their foes show no openings.",
                "Not only are the members of the group in black all powerful on their own, they're also working together in perfect harmony. By moving in three-woman units, they're able to cover one another's backs. Even if Alexia and Rose found a chink in their armor, it's clear their adversaries would seal it immediately. The group's teamwork is polished to a sheen.",
                "The door keeps closing.",
                "\"No! Please! Don't hurt me!\" As she's being shoved through the door, Natsume lets out a pained cry.",
                "\"Miss Natsume!!\"",
                "\"I-I'll be fine! Please don't worry about me!\" Natsume bravely calls out, her voice trembling, as she's dragged through the portal.",

                "After glancing around to make sure everything looks normal, Epsilon makes for the door with her captive in tow.",

                "A dark shadow swoops down and cleaves through Epsilon.",
                "\"Excellent work, Executioner Venom!!\" Nelson booms with a laugh.",
                "As Epsilon watches herself get cut, her concentration is at its peak.",
                "Although she was taken completely by surprise, her skills are sharpened to the point where she's able to bend her torso backward to evade the blow. However, this movement gives birth to tragedy.",
                "Epsilon's life flashes before her eyes.",
                "She remembers being an elf of noble bearing, becoming a \"possessed,\" and being cast aside and hunted by her people.",
                "Then, she remembers the day her life began anew.",
                "On that fateful day when Shadow rescued her, everything Epsilon thought she knew crumbled around her, and her life received new meaning.",
                "From childhood, Epsilon was strong-willed. She never once doubted her exceptionality, and her personality was such that she couldn't help but show off her talents.",
                "She came from a well-off family, and her beauty, brains, and martial arts talent were all the pinnacle of her generation.",
                "Though she had an abundance of pride, she always had the skills to back it up.",
                "Perhaps that was the reason.",
                "The day she became one of the possessed, the moment she lost everything, she was stricken with profound grief.",
                "She'd lost her reason to live, but she didn't have the courage to die, either.",
                "On that day, as she dragged her rotting flesh along a mountain trail, Shadow appeared before her.",
                "\"Do you seek power...?\"",
                "His voice had been deep, as though it were echoing from a bottomless abyss.",
                "Epsilon's mind was fuzzy, and she thought that perhaps she'd stumbled upon a demon.",
                "But she desired power all the same.",
                "With power, she could take revenge on all those who'd forsaken her.",
                "She could torture them to death. Make them regret what they'd done to her.",
                "\"Then I shall grant it to you...\"",
                "And with that, she found herself enveloped in soft magic with a blue-violet hue.",
                "Even now, she'd never once forgotten its light or its warmth.",
                "The warm, healing light felt almost nostalgic, and before Epsilon noticed it, she'd started crying.",
                "That day, Epsilon had been weak, ugly, and pathetic. Yet Shadow had saved her anyway.",
                "\"If you wish to descend into madness amid a world of lies, then do so. However, if you wish to see the world's true face...then follow me.\"",
                "And Epsilon chased after him.",
                "After losing everything, she'd been hideous. But once he saved that version of her, she felt as though he'd acknowledged her true self.",
                "She didn't need class.",
                "Neither did she need beauty nor pride in her talents.",
                "There were other things that were more important.",
                "After discovering the world's true nature and meeting her four predecessors, though, she amended that assessment.",
                "It was true: She had no need for her heritage, but talent was essential.",
                "And her prized combat skills had her ranked second from the bottom.",
                "Furthermore, the slots above her were occupied by monsters and flawless superhumans she had no chance of surpassing.",
                "The intellect she regarded so highly was second from the bottom as well.",
                "The geniuses before her had shattered her confidence.",
                "Even when it came to being well-rounded, she was beaten by perfect specimens and human machines who never made mistakes.",
                "At this rate, there would be nowhere left for her to excel.",
                "Except beauty.",
                "For Epsilon, her looks were essential. Her beloved master was a man, after all.",
                "When she evaluated her attractiveness objectively, she realized she was heading into an uphill battle.",
                "If faces were the only relevant criteria, Epsilon didn't have anything to be worried about, but she had to consider the future. The fact of the matter was, the women from her family had categorically been cursed with small, flat chests.",
                "Just as men lament their forefathers' hairlines, so, too, did Epsilon lament her chest lineage. She knew if things kept going as they were, the day would inevitably come when she suffered a crushing defeat.",
                "And so, when Epsilon encountered a certain thing for the first time, she felt like she'd been struck by lightning.",
                "The slime bodysuit.",
                "It took but a glance for her to realize the possibilities contained within it, and her heart instantly belonged to the suit.",
                "Although she normally hung on Shadow's every word, she didn't pay a lick of attention when he was explaining the slime bodysuit to her. She couldn't take her eyes off it.",
                "She realized something.",
                "She could push those puppies up.",
                "It only took her three days before she could control the slime bodysuit as she pleased.",
                "From that day forth, she wore the slime bodysuit everywhere under the pretext of practicing her control over it, and bit by bit, she added volume to her chest.",
                "The progress went little by little, so as not to arouse suspicion, but a smidgen audaciously, because she was, after all, a growing girl.",
                "Once they'd gotten reasonably large, though, she noticed something.",
                "They felt wrong to the touch.",
                "At the end of the day, slime was still slime. Her boobs felt different from the real thing, and the way they moved wasn't quite right, either. From that day forward, Epsilon observed Beta as though performing reconnaissance on an enemy, and a few days later, she was able to perfectly control her slime to replicate the jiggle and feel of the real deal.",
                "By this point, Epsilon's control over her magic had far surpassed even Alpha's.",
                "Though the others acknowledged her superiority and dubbed her Epsilon the Faithful, she had long since stopped caring about that.",
                "Instead, she observed Beta with a discerning eye, trembling all the while.",
                "How did hers keep growing?!",
                "This called for war: a battle without honor or humanity between the natural and the artificial.",
                "In the end, Epsilon padded some more and eventually emerged victorious. Mankind is a beast that consistently triumphs over the horrors of nature.",
                "However, the price for that victory was steep.",
                "On that day, as Epsilon saw her reflection in a mirror and lost the small shred of pride she'd regained, she realized something.",
                "Her proportions were off.",
                "Much to her dismay, her build was petite and dainty.",
                "However, Epsilon set her mind to work and eventually came up with a solution.",
                "All she needed to do to balance her figure was to make her butt bigger, too.",
                "In the end, though, she didn't just stop at the butt, which she used slime to reshape. She tightened up and corseted her belly. She used slime insoles to lengthen her legs and attain the best proportions. She... It would take forever to list out all the little things.",
                "In short, she used the slime bodysuit to obtain the perfect figure.",
                "It had taken incalculable effort, being constantly on guard without anyone knowing, and in the process, she developed the presence of a detestably worthy rival.",
                "More than anything, though, it had been a display of her feelings for her beloved master.",
                "Epsilon's precision was nothing more than a byproduct of that labor. Her true power was the amazing physical protection her many layers of slime padding provided.",

                "By manipulating the dregs of magic left in the two flying lumps, Epsilon forces them to retain their shape.",
                "To the trained eye, her ability to manipulate magic once it's left her body is enough to take one's breath away.",
                "At the same time, she yanks that magic back to her, instantly adhering the blobs back to their original position.",
                "Maintaining that level of inch-perfect control in the blink of an eye—it's nothing short of superhuman.",
                "As a final touch, she makes them jiggle just the way real breasts would. Such is the power of Epsilon the Faithful.",

                "\"I'm so sorry. We tripped and fell. And when we did, why—there was a door right there. It really wasn't our fault.\"",
                "It's in that moment Rose learns that having no shame can be persuasive in its own right.",
                "Alexia is obviously lying, but nobody can bring themselves to expend the effort calling her out on it, especially since she's speaking with the haughty attitude of a demon lord who's conquered the world.",
                "Whatever. Let's just let her have it, they all think as they look at her.",
                "\"If you agree to behave, you can do as you please. In fact, you probably have a right to know a few things,\" says Alpha, shooting a glance Alexia's way. Then, on her orders, the group in black fans out.",
                "\"Hooray!\" says Alexia as she quietly pumps her fist.",
                "The only ones left are Alpha, Nelson, Rose, Alexia, Natsume, and one other unidentified woman in black. She isn't Epsilon, though.",
                "\"What do you people intend to do here?\" Still bound by the woman in black, Nelson glares at Alpha.",

                "\"That sounds fun, but...that isn't what we're here to find out. We want to learn more about the Cult of Diablos.\"",
                "Alexia visibly flinches at the mention of the organization. Rose casts a sidelong glance at her and sees her gaze has gone steely.",

                "\"I knew you wouldn't be able to tell us anything. That's why we had to come see for ourselves, why we had to come searching for the truth—concealed from the very beginning within the shadows of history.\" Alpha turns around, then begins walking toward a large stone statue. Her heels echo throughout the spacious chamber. \"A statue of the great hero Olivier, I see.\"",

                "She's right—Alpha had referred to a statue of a woman holding a holy sword aloft. She is beautiful, with the fierce divinity of a Valkyrie.",
                "\"We have a general understanding of what happened. However, there is still some uncertainty: the historical truths, the real objective of the Cult, and\"—Alpha reaches out toward the statue and gently strokes its face—\"why Olivier's face is identical to mine.\"",
                "Alpha turns around. The mask that was covering her face is gone.",

                "Nelson looks down, refusing to answer.",
                "Rose can't make heads or tails of their conversation. However, it looks like Alexia is picking up on a bit, and the things Alpha is saying certainly don't sound like nonsense.",
                "It's hard to believe these two powerful organizations are dabbling in archaeology just because. There must be some important reason. The Shadow Garden must have an agenda, and the Cult of Diablos must have one of their own.",
                "The recent attack on her school immediately floats to the front of Rose's mind. There's no way that's unrelated to all this.",
                "A war between two powerful organizations is unfolding in the shadows. Rose shivers at this realization.",
                "If their conflict becomes more intense, Rose strongly doubts the uninformed government officials will be able to deal with it.",
                "\"We'd suspected the Cult's objective isn't as simple as just resurrecting a demon. However, we aren't certain. That's why we came to see for ourselves.\" As she speaks, Alpha channels magic into the statue. As her magic surges, the very air starts vibrating.",
                "\"...You are one of the possessed. Your powers. Did you awaken on your own...?\"",
                "When Rose sees the exceptional quantity of magic at work, a chill runs down her spine. If that woman were to turn her power against the nation, it would take an inordinate amount of military resources to stop her.",
                "\"There was a great battle here in the past. The hero sealed away the demon, and many valorous lives were lost. Afterward, the demon's and the warriors' magic twisted together, trapping all the memories that had lost their destinations. This land is a resting place for those ancient memories and that demon's wrath. A graveyard.\"",
                "The statue begins glowing, reacting to the magic. Ancient letters rise to its surface, and colors start spreading across it.",
                "\"Olivier, our great hero, I knew you would answer my call.\"",

                "After deciding the coast is probably clear, I return to my normal getup and let out a sigh of relief.",
                "Looks like I managed to pull it off somehow. Back at the stadium, the only thing anyone's talking about has to be Shadow the mysterious badass. That nobody from the Academy for Dark Knights must be long erased from the public imagination.",
                "I pulled out all the stops today, so I think I'll just head back, take a dip in the hot springs, and go to bed. Just as I stand up to leave, though, a weird door suddenly appears right in front of me.",
                "A dirty door is just floating out in the middle of the mountains. Huh. And it's covered in dark stains. Clearly dried blood.",
                "\"What's that?\"",
                "This is dodgy in the extreme. Even I know better than to mess with this.",

                "I put my katana away and think.",
                "Obviously, I can't head back to town with this seedy-looking door in tow. It would stick out like a sore thumb.",
                "And what even is this thing? I don't sense anyone else around, so I doubt it's some kind of weird prank. And there isn't anything behind it.",
                "\"Is it, like, their version of D—remon's Anyw—ere Door?\"",
                "This door is acting pretty desperate, so if I go in, I imagine this will all get resolved. I really just want to go soak in the hot spring and call it a day, though.",

                "That cage, on the other hand, is covered in blood. The next moment, however, it's as clean as though it had just undergone a scene change, and there's a girl inside. She suffers, then dies. Another girl appears shortly thereafter.",

If you want to think of it as a fairy tale, that's your choice.\" Alpha starts walking again. \"After all this time, there isn't much point debating the veracity of ancient history. We can't even know if these memories are all true. After all, they fade with time, reshaping themselves to fit their owner's narrative.\"",
                "They pass by caged room after caged room.",
                "As they trudge farther down the corridor, they find more empty cells. Olivier ages, eventually growing into a lovely young woman. Her face really does resemble Alpha's.",

                "\"That's bullshit!\" booms Nelson. He glares at Alpha, his face flushed. The woman in black hoists him up by the scruff of his neck, and he lets out a frog-like croak.",
                "\"Even after she grew powerful, Olivier still obeyed the Cult. It's unclear why, but we suspect it's because she truly believed that defeating Diablos would bring about peace. That's why she was cooperating with the Cult.\"",

                "After putting on a suit of armor and strapping a sword to her back, she sets out on a journey. Seeing Olivier's face, Alexia finds herself agreeing with Alpha's assessment.",

                "\"What is that...?\" Rose asks under her breath.",
                "The lump in question is a massive arm. It's a monster's arm—black, thick, and horrifically engorged. Chunks of torn flesh hang off its massive nails.",

                "\"...That can't be!\" cries Alexia. She looks at Nelson's face.",
                "But Alpha is right. Nelson's face is a perfect match for that of the man robed in white. They're more than similar—the two are undoubtedly one and the same.",

One little knock on my skull, and that could be it for me.\" Cid stands, patting his wound as if to make sure his body is still in one piece. \"But as long as you protect your vitals, you're surprisingly sturdy. You can get stabbed through the chest, but if you protect your arteries and important organs, you won't die. Kinda sweet, don't you think?\"",

                "In other words, opening a new store is financial suicide unless you can come up with a way to solve those fundamental problems.",
                "\"We would love it if you opened a store here!\"",
                "Rude is visibly desperate. He had, of course, heard rumors about the effect Mitsugoshi had on the imperial capital.",
                "If the retailer opened a store in Madlid, it would stop the city's population from dwindling further, and the graph of their failing financial situation would suddenly soar—or at least, that is what Rude has deluded himself into thinking.",
                "That's not how it'd actually go down.",
                "Until the underlying problems were solved, a new branch would be nothing more than a drop in the bucket.",

                "\"I—I hear you loud and clear. I'm willing to drop it to a flat one hundred million zeni!\"",
                "Seeing Gamma's indecision, he slashes the price even further.",
                "However, Gamma has no intention of giving him an answer for a reduction of a mere twenty million zeni. She's already spent over a week indecisively touring the town's real estate, and she hasn't given him a single definitive answer yet.",
                "She's already seen everything she needs to.",
                "Now she's just waiting.",
                "\"—Ms. Luna.\" And there it is. An attractive young woman dressed in a Mitsugoshi uniform comes up behind Gamma and whispers in her ear. \"We've finished the survey.\"",
                "\"And?\"",
                "\"It will work.\"",
                "\"Is it here?\"",

                "\"In fact, I'll take every plot along this road.\"",

                "\"Would you be willing to expand the Nyle River's tributaries and build a canal?\"",
                "\"Um...yes?\"",
                "\"Excellent, then let's get started.\" Gamma begins issuing orders to her subordinate. \"Buy up all the necessary land downstream of the Nyle. We're about to have a real estate bubble on our hands...\"",
                "With that, they take off briskly. Eventually, only the dumbfounded Rude remains.",
                "He gapes at his surroundings, then mutters, \"Oh, right... I have to report to Father...\"",
                "—The weak are worthless.",
                "Born and raised a therianthrope, she had this lesson drilled into her by her family.",
                "Her clan was large, even for canine therianthropes, and her father—the chief—had over a hundred children to his name. She had been born to one of his lower-ranked mistresses, so no one expected much from her.",
                "At mealtimes, her portions were meager, and she was always skinny and famished.",
                "When she turned three, they eventually stopped feeding her altogether.",
                "She was little more than skin and bones by the first time she staggered into the forest to hunt for herself. There, she slew a boar twice her size by bashing in its skull, then she drank its lifeblood and gorged herself on its organs.",
                "She realized then that not only could she sustain herself with her own two hands but doing so was surprisingly easy.",
                "Now she knew that was what it meant to live.",

                "It only held value if you hunted it yourself.",
                "After she returned to her village, drenched in her prey's blood, word began to spread.",
                "Even among therianthropes, a three-year-old girl killing a boar was hardly normal.",
                "Yet that was precisely what she had done.",
                "Her senses and physical strength were superlative, and she could even use magic despite never having had any formal training.",
                "If a child her age came picking a fight, she'd take them down in a single blow, and whenever she got hungry, she'd go off and hunt her own food.",
                "Her malnourished frame quickly filled out, and before long, she'd grown into a young girl with fair looks and supple muscles.",
                "By the time she turned twelve, the only person in her clan who could best her was the chief.",
                "It would only have taken a few more years—or maybe even just one—and she might well have surpassed him, too.",
                "However, that never happened.",
                "Instead, black bruises spread all across her body.",
                "She was...one of the possessed...",
                "...and the possessed had to be driven from the pack. That was an ironclad rule.",
                "After fleeing with her disease-ridden body, she began hunting throughout the forest and prowling aimlessly.",
                "She loved to hunt.",
                "Hunting had given her life. Every instinct in her body told her that hunting was what she had been born to do.",
                "Consequently, being driven from her pack didn't bother her much.",
                "As long as she could keep on living and hunting, she was fine with that.",
                "However, the illness ate away at her. Her body rotted, and she gradually grew so weak that it became impossible for her to hunt.",
                "She collapsed by a woodland stream and looked up at the heavens.",
                "\"I can...still...hunt...\"",
                "She could smell the beasts, sense their footsteps, hear their cries.",
                "The forest was massive, but she could make out traces of distant prey like it was right in front of her. If her body would only move the way she wanted it to, she could hunt them all down with ease.",
                "\"My prey...calling out...to me...\"",
                "But even though she extended her blackened, rotting hand, all she caught was air.",

                "Eventually, her vision grew dim.",
                "Knowing she didn't have long to live, she smiled when she heard a wolf howling nearby.",
                "The wolf had come to hunt her.",
                "This was her chance.",
                "She couldn't move anymore, but she could lure her prey to her.",
                "The moment the wolf tried to bite her, she would tear out its throat with her teeth.",
                "She stifled her breathing and waited for the wolf to come.",

                "The wolf's presence grew distant, and a blond elf appeared in its place.",
                "\"It's progressed pretty far... You must have an incredible force of will to be able to stay conscious in that state,\" the elf observed. She offered her hand but was frantically forced to retract it a moment later.",

                "The therianthrope girl's fangs met empty air.",
                "She turned her inflamed face toward the elf, glared at her, and smiled.",

                "With the last of her strength, she willed herself to her feet.",
                "Animals weren't the only prey she knew. Strife between therianthrope tribes was common, and hunting foes was something else she lived for.",
                "The moment she laid eyes on the elf, she knew: The girl standing before her was the kind of big game that really got her blood boiling.",
                "\"What...?! How can you still stand...?!\" The elf girl started to back away.",
                "\"Grah!!\" That's when the therianthrope girl pounced at her. No ailing person should have been able to move so fast.",

                "The elf dodged her fangs and retreated a good distance, but the therianthrope forced her unstable body to pursue.",
                "\"Stop that! I'm trying to help—! Seems like talking isn't getting me anywhere. I might end up hurting you, so it looks like I'll need to ask for his help...,\" she muttered, then turned around and left.",
                "\"W-wait...wai...t...\" The therianthrope chased her for a few steps, then collapsed headfirst.",
                "She no longer had the strength to go after her.",

                "Despondent, she closed her eyes.",
                "For a little while, all she heard was the quiet ambiance of the forest until nearby footsteps caught her ears. She opened her eyes in surprise.",
                "Standing beside her was a dark-haired boy dressed all in black. She couldn't feel his presence at all.",
                "\"My name is Shadow...\"",
                "When she looked up into his eyes, her whole body trembled.",

                "What told her that wasn't logic but instinct, and she comprehended it instantly.",
                "The only person stronger than her was her father, the chief of her clan, and even he didn't scare her.",
                "But this boy was different.",
                "His strength as a living creature was fundamentally beyond hers.",

                "The gulf between their strengths was so vast, though, she couldn't even muster the will to fight.",
                "She feared his strength and, as a matter of course, obeyed what her instincts told her to do in the face of a mightier being.",
                "In other words—she submitted.",
                "\"Purr...\"",

                "The girl wasn't fully healed but had recovered enough to be able to walk around again.",
                "\"I'm Alpha. I'm sorry for springing this on you, but I'd like to explain a few things about our organization and your body—\"",
                "As the elf named Alpha began droning on about some incomprehensible nonsense, the therianthrope girl examined her body.",
                "Thanks to the Shadow boy's magic, she'd recovered remarkably.",
                "She would never forget the strength and warmth of his magic.",
                "Now, she could hunt again.",
                "\"—and because of that, we fight against the Cult.\"",

                "She had no objections to that.",
                "After all, its chief, Shadow, was the strongest being she knew. To serve the strong was her pride.",
                "As long as it had Shadow, this pack would become the strongest in the world.",

                "Boss man was amazing! He was the strongest. As far as she was concerned, he was the best in all the world!",
                "That was why there was something she needed to do.",
                "She glanced at the three elves standing around her. The blue one wasn't even in contention. The silver one was so-so. The blond one, though, was strong.",
                "Shadow was the pack's undisputed top dog, which meant Alpha was surely his number two.",

                "She only sleeps for three hours. However, her master taught her a technique that removes fatigue with magic while she sleeps, so three hours is plenty for her. Ample beauty sleep.",
                "By only sleeping three hours a day, she's able to spend the other twenty-one productively.",
                "She takes care of her training and missions, of course, but her number one priority is self-improvement.",
                "That's why she wakes up early to stand in front of the mirror.",
                "The first thing she needs to inspect are her slime-padded breasts.",

                "She absolutely can't let anyone find out about her padded little secret.",
                "They have to be realer than real, more natural than natural. That's the standard to which she holds her chest as she inspects the slime.",
                "After almost an hour of rotating and massaging, she finishes her inspection and fine-tuning.",
                "Next, she makes sure her figure is well proportioned.",
                "Does her waist corseted in slime cast an appropriate silhouette?",
                "Are her thickened hips beautiful?",
                "What about the slim plumpness of her butt, the form of her calves...the length of her legs...?",
                "By the time she's finished all of her checks, the morning sun has long since risen.",
                "She then sheds her negligee, dons a casual dress atop her slime, applies her makeup, and does her hair.",
                "At this point, she's finally fit to appear in front of others.",
                "As the finishing touch, she stands in front of the mirror one last time, twirls, and readies her Epsilon-style Hidden Technique: Master Shadow Come-Hither Pose.",
                "\"Beautiful as ever,\" she sighs with a smile. Her voice is rich with confidence.",
                "All of this is for her master's sake. This is the extent to which she's pushed her daily routine.",
                "However, she holds the Master Shadow Come-Hither Pose longer than usual today. As she maintains the position, which serves to emphasize her slime breasts, an unpleasant smile spreads across her face.",
                "\"Heh-heh... Heh-heh-heh... Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha!\"",
                "She's smiling because she's reminiscing.",
                "Specifically, she's thinking about something that happened the other day in Lindwurm, back when she was reunited with her master after a long absence.",
                "She'd elegantly dispatched one of the Cult's assassins as she swooped down before Lord Shadow.",
                "Whenever she was reunited with her master, her heart always beat even harder than usual. This time, though, he'd been staring right at her...",
                "...and his fierce gaze had locked on her breasts!",
                "Epsilon's beauty, glamour, and effort had finally snatched her master's attention.",
                "Her cheeks had reddened, but she'd pretended not to notice her master's fervent gaze. As soon as he left, though, her feelings erupted, and she let out a loud victory cry.",
                "\"I won! I beat Mother Nature!\"",
                "Immediately after, she snapped back to her senses.",
                "This isn't Lindwurm, the Sacred Land. It's her bedroom.",
                "However, the memory is etched in her heart: that fleeting moment with her master's gaze burning into her chest—",

                "Finally, she releases the Master Shadow Come-Hither Pose. However, the wicked smile is still plastered on her lips.",

                "Their gazes are focused elsewhere—each other's breasts.",
                "Each of their chests sticks out like a pair of rockets, and they stare at their opponent's assets as if gazing upon an archnemesis.",
                "Then, they both thrust out their chests.",
                "Each sucks in as much air as they possibly can, projecting their breasts forward to their absolute limit.",

                "Originally, their battle had been one-sided hostility on Epsilon's part.",
                "However, as Epsilon used her slime to push up and pad, a sense of rivalry took root in Beta, and today, Epsilon isn't the only one with something black and ugly stuffed in her chest.",
                "Still, they are teammates.",
                "They've suffered through difficult training and fought side by side, and the two of them definitely share a sense of comradery.",
                "Each trusts and considers the other important.",
                "Most of the time, they're able to get along peacefully.",
                "Key word: most of the time.",
                "Normally, after exchanging greetings, they simply pass by and continue on their ways. Having spent countless hours together since childhood, they feel little need to share prolonged pleasantries.",

                "\"Gh... Our lord...? There's no way...\" Mortified, Beta glares at Epsilon.",
                "\"I mean, is it even proper for our lord to fall for someone as lowly as me...?\" Epsilon sniggers as she puts emphasis on that last bit. \"After all, think about it. Your figure is so much nicer than mine, Beta, and you're so much prettier!\"",

At this rate, it'll finish up right on schedule just as summer break ends. Once, Skel got riled up and said, \"I wish the whole damn thing had burned down,\" and I couldn't help but agree with him.

                "\"Oh, right, apropos of nothing, but do you have any idea where Princess Rose is?\"",
                "\"Princess Rose, you say. Beta was in charge of that incident, but as far as what I know goes...I did hear she'd fled underground, beneath the capital. You could try asking Beta for more specifics...\"",
                "\"Oh, no worries. That's plenty to go off of.\" If I'm lucky enough to run into Rose, maybe I'll get a chance to chat with her. \"Thanks. Uh...\"",
                "As I look at Epsilon's smile, I try to think of what to say to thank her.",
                "I was super-happy when she said she liked the \"Moonlight Sonata,\" so she'll probably feel the same way if I say something she wants to hear, too. \"Your figure looks great, as always.\"",
                "\"O-oh, no—no—no, i-it really doesn't! I'm still working on it...!\"",
                "Unable to keep looking at Epsilon's face, I turn my attention to the scenery outside the window.",
                "This is how the world goes round, I think as I gaze at the endless blue summer sky.",
                "Rose walks down the dark underground tunnel.",
                "Blood is still trickling from the wound she sustained on her back during her escape. The cut isn't deep, but it definitely isn't shallow, either.",
                "It should have been treated immediately, but Rose's pursuers haven't given her time to indulge in such luxuries.",
                "Instead, she's focusing her magic on the wound to prevent it from getting any worse. As time presses on, though, the pain grows and her stamina dwindles.",
                "Her breathing is shallow.",
                "As she keeps an eye out for her assailants, her mind keeps racing.",
                "What had been the right thing for her to do?",
                "What would have brought about the best outcome?",
                "The questions spiral around in her mind, but no answers seem forthcoming.",
                "Stabbing Perv, her fiancé, had been a spur-of-the-moment decision. She hadn't done it impulsively, though. She'd used the limited time she had to figure out her best option, then acted on it...or at least, she'd tried to.",
                "But she'd failed.",
                "Perv had survived, and she had to flee.",
                "However, it was only a failure in hindsight. She'd misjudged Perv's skill, but the choice to eliminate him hadn't been wrong in and of itself.",
                "In fact, she'd had no choice. The moment she'd seen her father's—King Oriana's—lifeless eyes, she knew she had to get rid of Perv. In her estimation, all the rumors—Perv's connection to the Cult and the empty puppet that was left of her father—had changed to fact.",
                "That was why she'd drawn her blade.",
                "Had she been overly impulsive?",
                "Had she acted in haste?",
                "Could she really say she hadn't been spurred on by impatience and rage?",
                "Rose had thought she was making the rational choice.",
                "She hadn't wanted to rely on Alexia and Natsume. After all, the Oriana Kingdom had to resolve the matter internally. That had only been a hunch, but Rose had been confident in it.",
                "And politically, at least, she'd been right.",
                "Her gambit had ended in failure because of it, but it was still Rose's mistake and the Oriana Kingdom's problem. The Midgar Kingdom still hadn't gotten wrapped up in the mess. She'd subconsciously dodged the worst-case scenario.",
                "It was just a matter of time, though, before that came to pass, too.",
                "The words Perv yelled after her as she'd fled echo within her ears.",
                "\"Turn yourself in before the Bushin Festival ends! Or I'll make King Oriana kill one of the other guests of honor!\"",
                "If King Oriana really did kill another dignitary like Perv said...it would mean war. Rose isn't sure how serious he was about that, but it's possible the Cult only sees King Oriana as a minor pawn.",
                "And if that's the case...",
                "Rose grinds her teeth. Her face contorts in anguish.",
                "Her father is no brilliant leader, and Oriana is no vast kingdom.",
                "To her, though, they're the only father and motherland she has.",
                "All she wanted was to protect them.",
                "But that desire led to impatience.",
                "Rose slams her fist against the tunnel wall.",
                "At the end of the day, she let her emotions get the better of her and acted impulsively. She'd thought she could just kill Perv and fix everything, but that had been naive.",
                "Perv was nothing more than a sacrificial pawn. She should have realized how deep the Cult's roots ran throughout Oriana and that killing him wouldn't accomplish anything.",
                "There has to be some other option...some magical action she can take that would fix everything...",
                "Rose slumps onto the damp ground.",
                "Implausible scenarios dance through her mind, taunting her. If only she'd done something cleverer and everything had lined up neatly...",
                "But now, it's all over. She isn't even sure why she's fleeing.",
                "What good would escaping do her?",
                "What would it change?",
                "Shouldn't she turn herself in?",
                "Yeah...that'd be for the best.",
                "\"I see... All I have to do is turn myself in.\"",
                "She still doesn't know what the optimal course had been then. However, her best option now is simple.",
                "By turning herself in, she can at least prevent a war.",
                "Thinking that makes her feel a little better. At the same time, she's assailed with sorrow and grief, as though she's lost something precious to her.",
                "Rose pulls the Tuna King wrapper from her pocket. She ate the sandwich long ago, but it still smells faintly of bread.",
                "It reminds her of a certain boy with black hair. He's almost certainly heard what's happened by now. She wonders what he thinks of it.",
                "Is he worried about her?",
                "Does he still believe in her?",
                "Is he perhaps...searching for her himself?",
                "If she'd been able to kill Perv and bring the king back to his senses... If a future existed where everything had gone right... Would she have been able to marry him and live out her life by his side?",
                "That is, no doubt, what she's been dreaming of.",
                "\"I'm sorry...\" Rose chokes out the words.",
                "A single tear rolls down her cheek.",
                "Her actions had shattered that picturesque dream into pieces.",
                "Rose delicately folds up the Tuna King wrapper and puts it in her skirt pocket. She thinks of it almost as her dream's last remaining fragment.",
                "\"Ow...!\"",
                "A sharp pain runs through her chest. When she parts her clothes to look at it, she finds a series of dark bruises.",
                "It's a symptom of the possession. The bruises only appeared recently.",
                "Rose hangs her head and lets out an empty laugh. Her dream was never destined to come to fruition.",
                "Suddenly, a small noise reaches Rose's ears.",
                "Is it her pursuers' footsteps?",
                "No—it's too gentle, too lovely to be footsteps. When she strains her ear, she recognizes it as a piano.",
                "\"'Moonlight Sonata'...?\"",
                "She's well versed in music, so she's familiar with the piece. The composition received unusually high praise, even in Oriana, a kingdom of the arts, and now she can hear it coming from the end of the tunnel.",
                "\"It's beautiful...\"",
                "It's as though the \"Moonlight Sonata\" is all there is.",
                "The performance is polished to a profound degree of perfection, almost as though the pianist's entire life was spent building up to this one piece.",
                "Rose follows the music toward the source as if a ray of moonlight is beckoning her.",
                "The tunnels are referred to as the capital's underground labyrinth, but they feel less like a labyrinth and more like ruins. The walls are made of sturdy stone and covered in carvings and ancient glyphs.",
                "Each has a number of doors in it, but the majority of them don't open. Maybe they need keys, or perhaps some mechanism inside the ruins is stuck.",
                "Rose can hear herself getting closer to the piano.",
                "When she turns the corner, she discovers a massive, dilapidated door.",
                "The noise is coming from beyond it.",
                "When she slips through one of the door's large holes, she finally reaches the source of the music.",
                "She's in a cathedral filled with fantastical light. On the wall, there's a set of stained-glass windows depicting the heroes and a dismembered demon.",
                "Light rains down from beyond the stained glass.",
                "It's all centered on a grand piano.",
                "\"Shadow...\"",
                "He's the one playing \"Moonlight Sonata\" in the abandoned cathedral.",
                "Rose closes her eyes and takes in the beautiful melody.",
                "Shadow's \"Moonlight Sonata\" is different from all the other renditions Rose has ever heard. The composition is the same, but thanks to the instrumentalist, the tone is different.",
                "Shadow's \"Moonlight Sonata\" is one of darkness.",
                "The deep, permeating darkness of the night with a single ray of light shining through it.",
                "Perhaps that ray is coming from the moon, or perhaps...",
                "The piece reaches its conclusion before Rose can come up with an answer.",
                "She takes in the music's final reverberations, then claps.",
                "Her solo applause echoes through the cathedral.",
                "Shadow, of course, hears it. He rises from his seat and replies with an elegant bow.",
                "\"Shadow, that was...\"",
                "When Rose gets to that point in her sentence, though, she realizes that she doesn't know what to say next. She just knows she has to say something or Shadow will leave.",
                "\"That was, without a doubt, the finest rendition of 'Moonlight Sonata' I've ever heard. Um...\"",
                "Rose finds herself wondering what she's trying to get at.",
                "This isn't what she needs to ask him.",
                "\"What have you wrought...?\" Shadow's voice echoes like it's coming from the abyss itself.",
                "\"What...?\" Rose thinks for a moment, then understands. He's asking why she did what she did. \"I...\" She casts her gaze down, then chokes out the words. \"I just wanted to protect everyone... I wanted to reach a happier future... But I couldn't make that happen...!\"",
                "\"Is this where it ends...?\"",
                "\"What...?\"",

                "\"If you have the will to fight...then I shall bestow it upon you,\" says Shadow. Bluish-purple magic gathers atop his palm. \"I shall grant you power...\"",

                "And the bluish-purple magic bursts.",
                "It makes a beeline for Rose, then plunges into her chest and body.",
                "The power's warmth suppresses her raging magic and settles it. It was heavy and uncontrollable a moment ago, but now she can command it with ease.",
                "\"It's amazing...\"",
                "Her voice is full of sincerity.",

                "I wasn't huge on the reserved seating at first, but now that I've gotten used to it, it certainly has its perks. The friendly maids bring me pretty much anything I ask for free of charge, and it makes me feel kinda like a celebrity.",
                "As I'm basking in the stadium's energy, Princess Iris makes her appearance.",
                "\"Good morning.\"",
                "\"Morning.\"",
                "\"Is that coffee I see? It's been trendy lately. I enjoy the smell, but the bitterness is a bit much for me...\"",
                "\"You could always just make it into coffee milk with loads of sugar.\"",
                "\"Coffee milk...?\"",
                "Iris calls over one of the maids and orders one. She really is a woman of action.",
                "\"Oh, this is nice...\"",
                "\"Right? It's like a magic trick you can use to make every cup of coffee taste the same.\"",
                "I follow her lead and order myself a fine banquet of toast and eggs.",
                "If only this world had social media. The only way to make this meal better would be if I could upload a smug selfie with the caption \"Eating breakfast in the deluxe suite with royalty!\"",
                "I finish eating right as various socialites begin trickling in.",
                "As the name would suggest, their advent brings with it the beginning of the socializing. Being the lowly son of a baron, I am completely left out of the conversation. It's fine, though—I'd just as soon stay out. So please, Princess Iris, stop trying to be nice enough to include me.",
                "Things end up getting kind of awkward, but eventually, the second round of the primaries gets underway.",
                "The socialites take their seats, but right as things start settling down, the door opens up.",
                "I turn around and see a woman in a faded robe.",
                "It conceals her face like it did before, but I can tell it's Beatrix.",
                "She notices me and gives me a little wave, and I reply with a nod and a smile. We meet again.",
                "However, the rest of the socialites' gazes are cold.",
                "I can practically hear them all thinking. Who is this woman wearing a filthy robe? Remove her at once! The silence is stifling.",
                "\"Ma'am, I'm sorry, but you can't...\" One of the maids calls out to her but gets interrupted.",
                "\"It's fine. She's with me. Please come on in,\" beckons Iris as she invites Beatrix in.",
                "Beatrix comes and sits two seats down from me. Iris is between us. Apparently, that was going to be Alexia's seat, if she was here.",
                "\"Princess Iris, who is she?\"",
                "\"Beatrix the War Goddess.\"",

                "\"It has. I'm looking for someone.\" Beatrix nods as she answers the socialite's question. \"My niece. She looks just like me.\"",
                "Making sure not to repeat the mistake she made with me, she takes off her hood.",
                "\"Damn, you're fine...\"",
                "\"Do any of you recognize my face? I heard this country had sightings of an elf bearing my visage.\"",
                "\"In this country, huh...? If I saw an elf as fair as you, Beatrix, I'd never forget it.\"",
                "\"Have any of you seen her?\"",
                "\"Sorry...\"",
                "The socialites all shake their heads.",
                "\"I see...\" Disappointed, she puts her hood back up.",

                "\"It's fine. I'm an elf, so I have time.\"",
                "\"By the way, did you watch any of the Bushin Festival?\"",
                "\"Not much.\"",
                "\"Oh. Well, based on what you've seen, did any of the contestants catch your interest?\"",
                "\"My interest... Hmm...\" She glances around as she thinks. \"Cid.\"",
                "She points at me.",

                "\"Cid caught my interest. Someday, he'll be strong.\"",
                "I instantly deny it. \"Oh, no, I definitely won't.\"",
                "I can feel everyone staring at me.",

                "\"It's true he was in the same class as me, but his fundamentals were kinda...eh...\"",
                "\"He is Claire's little brother, but he doesn't take to it the way she does...\"",
                "Finally, Iris cuts through the strained atmosphere, and that's the end of that. \"If that's what you think, Beatrix, then I'm certain you're right.\"",
                "Still, though, the socialites eye Beatrix skeptically.",
                "I can see them glancing at one another, as though asking themselves, Is she the real deal...?",
                "To them, she probably just looks like a dirty wanderer.",
                "The way I see it, though, she carries herself naturally in the best sense of the word.",
                "Her form, her personality, her bearing, and her strength as a whole are all so unembellished that nobody realizes her real power.",
                "\"Now, would you mind if I was forward enough to ask you to point out anything interesting you notice during the matches?\"",
                "\"Okay.\"",
                "Thanks to Iris's deference, though, it starts to feel like Beatrix is getting a bit of respect.",
                "The air is still a little strained as the second round of the Bushin Festival primaries begins.",
                "When Perv walks into the deluxe suite, a figure in a gray robe turns and stares at him.",
                "The person's face is hidden beneath a hood, but given the build, he can tell it's probably a woman. After looking at Perv, she turns her gaze to King Oriana, who's standing beside him.",
                "Her assessment is brief.",
                "\"It stinks.\"",
                "\"That's pretty rude, lady.\"",
                "\"Sorry.\"",
                "Perv suppresses his beating heart as he glares at the woman.",
                "He's using a highly addictive herb to make a puppet of King Oriana. He has no complaints about the drug's effectiveness, but it has the downside of causing its users to exude a characteristic aroma.",
                "However, he's masking the smell with perfume. There's no way anyone has found him out.",
                "\"Perv, this is Beatrix the War Goddess.\"",
                "\"She's...\"",
                "Beatrix the War Goddess. Perv heard she'd made her way to the capital, but here she is in the flesh.",
                "She certainly doesn't look talented enough to merit the title of War Goddess.",
                "Her robe is faded, and her manners are nonexistent. After a single word of apology, she's already back to watching the match.",
                "But even though she doesn't look strong...if she's as talented as the rumors say, there's a chance he just can't perceive her strength. Given that Princess Iris acknowledges her as the real thing, he should assume she's right.",
                "He knows that the War Goddess's face looks reminiscent of the great hero Olivier's. If he could just get a good look...",

                "\"Me, too.\"",
                "Perv and Beatrix both apologize, and things settle down a bit. Now everyone will think Beatrix's verbal gaffe had been a reference to Perv himself.",
                "Perv desperately wants to get off the topic of the smell.",
                "He never imagined Beatrix would show up at the Bushin Festival, though.",
                "And today of all days...",
                "He quietly clicks his tongue.",
                "\"King Midgar, I trust you're well today?\"",
                "\"Oh, very.\"",
                "Perv changes his tone and offers salutations to King Midgar, who's sitting atop a large throne placed among the deluxe suite's seats.",
                "After exchanging a set of standard greetings, King Oriana sits down beside King Midgar. Perv takes the next seat down and turns his attention to covering King Oriana's conversational back.",
                "The king can answer simple questions, but anything more complex will give him trouble. Perv has no choice but to guide the conversation and prevent King Oriana from screwing up.",
                "That said, everything has gone according to plan so far.",
                "His primary objective is securing Rose.",
                "During their last encounter, she was already starting to show symptoms. Her blood would undoubtedly prove a valuable asset to the Cult.",
                "In order to ensure he gets her, he made a point of properly incentivizing her.",
                "Specifically, he threatened to have King Oriana kill King Midgar if Rose doesn't show up at the Bushin Festival.",
                "It was just a threat, of course, but Perv wouldn't particularly mind following through with it.",
                "King Midgar's death would incite a war, and the Oriana Kingdom would be finished. However, they already had plans underway to install a puppet leader in Midgar afterward. If all went well, everything would fall into his lap. There was a risk of abject failure, sure, but the potential rewards were worth it.",
                "The only thing that made him feel uneasy was the fact that Iris was there. Perv could see she distrusted the hollow King Oriana. There was a chance she'd be able to stop him.",
                "However, he could easily remove that threat by simply conducting the assassination during Iris's match. There shouldn't have been any additional impediments.",
                "But now Beatrix is here. Getting rid of her will be tough, and she's probably even stronger than Iris. If Beatrix tries to stop him, she'll be a greater obstacle than Iris.",
                "Also, he still doesn't know what Mundane is after. Mundane is undoubtedly a denizen of the underworld, meaning he must have some objective. No matter how hard Perv searches, though, he keeps coming up blank. This guy's a pro. Perv needs to be on high alert.",
                "He lets out a heavy sigh.",
                "Everything's going according to plan, but there are too many variables. He doesn't feel remotely at ease.",
                "Still, if Rose just shows up, everything's golden. He won't need to take any risks.",
                "And she's sure to. She can't just abandon her homeland and her father. Perv knows her well enough to be certain of that.",
                "True, there are a bunch of variables, but none of them matter. Everything's going to be fine.",
                "Perv keeps telling himself that as he shifts his focus to the match.",
                "Time passes, and Claire Kagenou wins her bout handily.",
                "\"Oh-ho...\"",
                "He hadn't taken much notice of her before, but it turns out she's unexpectedly skilled. Her magic is powerful, yet she doesn't let it control her.",
                "As strong as she is now, she has the potential to become even stronger.",
                "\"It would seem...that Claire's gotten better.\" After watching Claire take down her opponent, Iris stands from her seat. \"My match is starting, so I'm afraid I must be off.\"",
                "Everyone around her offers words of encouragement, and the dark-haired boy sitting next to her stands as well.",
                "\"I gotta hit the can.\"",
                "Nobody much cares about his comings and goings. Well, nobody except Beatrix, who watches as he leaves.",
                "His name is Cid, and he's utterly unremarkable. Perv was a little curious how he ended up sitting next to the princess, but other than that, he doesn't see much reason to care. He immediately forgets about Cid and turns his attention to the next round.",
                "Iris and Mundane's bout is a very important one for Perv.",
                "He needs to figure out Mundane's strength and agenda as well as take advantage of the opportunity Iris's absence poses.",
                "After the two of them leave, a little time passes...and Iris and Mundane take the stage.",
                "When Iris arrives on the field, she's greeted with a thunderous round of applause.",
                "Her popularity makes it abundantly clear which one of the pair is the tournament's protagonist.",
                "She stares at Mundane and composes herself.",
                "Mundane Mann is obviously going to be a fierce opponent. Even now that she's standing across from him, she can't get a read on his strength but senses something unfathomable lurking within him. His appearance is out of sync with his actual ability. It makes him seem irregular, like he's hiding his true nature.",
                "However, Iris still is confident she can prevail. She has no other choice.",
                "She believes it's her duty to win the Bushin Festival.",
                "She isn't skilled at politics, and she herself knows that. The only thing she can do for Midgar is act as a symbol of its strength.",
                "It's her duty to instill faith in people that as long as Iris Midgar is around, the kingdom will be safe.",
                "Even if that means letting herself be carried on the shoulders of others. She's at peace with that. Her strength is her only asset, and she was content letting herself be used as a political pawn.",
                "Until recently, that is.",
                "That was a price she paid for being carried by others for so long: She stumbled the first time she tried to stand on her own two feet. Fearing for her country's future, she'd tried to assemble the Crimson Order but found herself powerless, unable to secure personnel or funds.",
                "If she tried gathering members gradually, it would take ages before the Crimson Order lived up to her expectations.",
                "Even if she attempted to involve herself in politics, people would still just treat her with superficial respect while using her for their own ends. That's why she's opted to leave the politics to others and gather strength in areas in which she's more skilled.",
                "For example, she knows that popularity among the masses is a strength in and of itself. She's also gathered allies she trusts to be the brains behind her Order. All that's left to do is win the Bushin Festival and solidify the people's love for her, and she's sure things will turn out well.",
                "With that belief firm in her heart, she readies her sword and waits for the announcer.",
                "Her condolences to Mundane, but she plans on going all out from the get-go. Even if he does have something up his sleeve, she intends to end the match before he has time to pull it out.",
                "\"Iris Midgar versus Mundane Mann!! Ready? Begin!!\"",
                "She wastes no time.",
                "As soon as the match starts, she steps forward, then stops.",
                "\"...What?\"",
                "A tiny cry of confusion slips from her lips.",
                "For some reason, Mundane seems farther away than he did before.",
                "Has she misjudged the distance between them?",
                "That's her first thought, but she knows she didn't. Still, it feels like the gap between them has widened.",
                "She doesn't know why. Maybe it's just nerves.",
                "Whatever the cause of her confusion, though, it definitely stops her.",
                "She tries starting over.",
                "She resets her emotions, readies her sword, and goes for a simple feint.",
                "When she's sure she's drawn Mundane's gaze, she rushes him.",
                "However...",
                "\"...?!\"",
                "Once again, she stops in her tracks.",
                "She leans backward as though dodging something, then leaps back.",
                "She had seen a sword.",
                "She had seen Mundane's sword severing her neck.",
                "However, Mundane's actual sword hadn't moved an inch.",
                "And of course, her neck was still attached to her shoulders.",
                "\"Why...?\" Iris can't keep the question inside.",
                "She's sure she saw Mundane's blade.",
                "The moment she advanced, she saw his sword and the colossal power lurking within it cutting her throat.",
                "She thought he'd read her like a book. And she'd seen her own defeat...no, her death.",
                "However, Mundane is still just standing there. His sword isn't even at the ready. It's as though it had all been just an illusion.",
                "She can't comprehend what just happened.",
                "Iris slowly paces around him, trying to figure out what's up with his sword.",
                "One lap, two laps, three laps...",
                "They're the exact same distance from each other as before. So why does Mundane look so far away?",
                "\"...Aren't you coming?\" Mundane asks.",
                "Yet she can't take that step.",
                "Every bone in her body is screaming for her not to go.",
                "\"Hrrraaaaahhhhhhh!!\"",
                "She roars in an attempt to dispel her hesitation.",
                "After rocking back and forth, she puts one foot forward. It's the fastest step she's ever taken.",
                "But—he's looking at her!!",
                "Unblinking, Mundane's eyes are trained on her.",
                "His gaze shifts, as though implying something.",
                "\"...Aahhhhhhh!!\"",
                "The moment it does, Iris's instincts force her to stop.",
                "Doing so places a massive strain on her body, and her knee joints make an unpleasant noise.",
                "She stops in spite of that, then practically tumbles backward.",
                "She's certain she just saw Mundane's sword running her through.",
                "\"No...\"",
                "However, her chest doesn't have a scratch.",
                "There's no sign Mundane's weapon ever moved.",
                "\"You're kidding...\"",
                "He's still just standing there, not even bothering to put up a defense.",

                "Unease and fear swirl up inside her.",
                "Mundane's gaze shifts again.",
                "As he stares straight ahead, the tip of his sword twitches as though he's predicting the future.",
                "The moment it does, Iris envisions her arm getting lopped off.",
                "\"Oh no...\"",
                "Now she finally realizes.",
                "Mundane had simply been making feints.",
                "He understood her movements in their entirety, then used his eyes and minute movements of the tip of his sword to send her a warning.",
                "If you don't stop, you'll get cut, he'd been telling her.",
                "That had been enough to make her hallucinate.",
                "That's how real the illusion had been.",
                "Iris recalls something her mentor once taught her: \"An expert's 'lies' seem all too real.\" And sure enough, she'd fallen for her mentor's feints time and time again.",
                "Mundane's moves felt even realer than her mentor's.",
                "Was that even possible?",
                "Iris isn't conceited enough to think she's the strongest person in the world. She understands that greatness is relative. Objectively speaking, though, she's supposed to be one of the best dark knights alive.",
                "To be able to drive a woman like her into a corner with feints alone?",
                "That would make Mundane, without a doubt, the world's strongest fighter.",
                "It would represent a degree of skill no one could hope to match.",
                "Was that really possible?",
                "Like hell it was.",
                "Iris forces herself to believe that.",
                "Don't get rattled.",
                "He hasn't even raised his sword yet. Don't go deciding the match on mere speculation.",

                "After steeling her resolve not to stop, she takes that one step forward.",
                "Something whizzes through the air.",
                "A second passes.",
                "Then, a fierce impact rocks Iris's body.",
                "Her mind goes blank for a few seconds, and before she knows it, she's looking up at the sky.",
                "She's collapsed faceup in the dead center of the arena.",

                "\"That's pretty expensive.\"",
                "\"Oh, no, missy. A dark knight slave of this caliber'd run you double that anywhere else. You won't get prices like this anywhere but the Lawless City!\"",

                "With each passing day, the moon seems to get even redder, and I'm pretty sure I'm not just imagining things. I guess the moon in this world really is different from the one back on Earth...",
                "The people of the Lawless City pay the moon no heed as they mill about on their business. They focus on the things they need to get through the day—for some, that's their next customer, and for others, their next mark.",

                "Having slain the red ghoul in a single strike, the warrior swings their sword to shake it clean of blood.",

Vampires have three weaknesses. First, they die if their hearts are destroyed. Although they're feared for their immortality and incredible regenerative powers, they can no longer revive if their hearts are destroyed. Learning that fact was a great boon to the humans, who lived in fear of them. Second, they lose their powers if they fail to drink blood. Any vampire who goes too long without blood becomes no stronger than an average human. Thus, they're biologically forced to coexist with humanity, unable to ever exterminate them fully. Third and finally, they turn to ash if they're struck by the sun's light. No matter how strong they are and how weak we are, all a human has to do to kill them is find a way to hit them with sunlight. They can employ traps, destroy their dwellings... The possibilities are endless. Because of that, the daytime came to serve as their execution grounds.\"",

                "Vampires hunted and killed humans practically for sport. Most of them saw humans as base livestock, and there were even some countries where they reigned over them wholesale.",
                "For the vampires, it was their golden age.",
                "Elisabeth, however, couldn't stand the idea of hunting more humans than was necessary.",
                "Because of that, she hunted only the bare minimum she needed to survive, refusing to take their lives in excess. There was no shortage of vampires who opposed her methods, so despite her power, her followers numbered few.",
                "Soon, though, the vampires entered their dark age.",
                "The humans began hunting the vampires back, turning the vampires' era into one of nightmares. The destruction of the vampires' capital sparked the fire of rebellion, and the vampires' numbers dwindled in the blink of an eye.",
                "At the time, Elisabeth and her followers ruled a small human country. They plowed the fields right alongside the humans, fought off monsters together, and protected their borders.",
                "Vampires didn't look down on humans in her lands, nor did humans fear vampires. The way they maintained that relationship was by not drinking blood.",
                "Without drinking human blood, vampires can't go on living.",
                "That was the prevailing belief at the time, but by abstaining herself, Elisabeth disproved this theory.",
                "Progenitors' compulsion to drink blood is dozens of times stronger than that of normal vampires. The pain she endured must have been unimaginable. But she successfully went cold turkey through agony comparable to lopping her own arm off. Upon seeing her resolve, her followers did the same.",
                "Without drinking blood, the vampires gradually lost their powers, eventually becoming no stronger than humans.",
                "However, there were things that they gained, too.",
                "For one, they gained the power to stay out in the sun. By giving up blood, they became able to live in the same beautiful, sunlit world as humans.",
                "They also gained tranquility in their hearts. By abstaining from blood and living their lives basking in the sun's rays, their urge to drink gradually subsided. Eventually, their dispositions were no different from humans.",
                "Despite all that, Elisabeth the Progenitor's powers were as great as ever.",
                "Her skin would become inflamed when exposed to the light, so she couldn't go outside without a thick black parasol. The only reason it didn't instantly turn her to ash was because most Progenitors had a certain degree of resistance to sunlight in the first place.",
                "Also, no matter how long she went without blood, her maddening urges never ceased.",
                "Yet despite her agony, she carried out her life beneath her parasol just the same as all the others. Eventually, she gathered up her followers and spoke to them.",
                "\"Let us build a Haven here. A land where humans and vampires can live in peace...\"",
                "And by taking in and protecting vampires being pursued by humanity, her followers' ranks grew.",
                "Of course, the condition for her protection was that they give up blood.",
                "Some of them resented her for this and revolted against her. It was with a heavy heart that she had to exile them. Some refused to comply, and those she put down herself.",
                "At some point, all the vampires in the world came under human attack, and they all gathered under Elisabeth's banner.",
                "Her population expanded, humans and vampires mingled together, and her land prospered. She used her great powers to defend her lands, so vampire hunters dared not enter.",
                "The Haven she'd set out to create was a success.",
                "She prayed everyone would be able to continue living in peace.",
                "However, all it took was a single night for the Haven to fall.",
                "It was the night the Red Moon rose in the sky.",
                "Elisabeth's urge to drink grew ever stronger, so she was forced to lock herself away in her castle.",
                "Back then, Mary was her second-in-command, and Crimson was her third.",
                "The two of them took turns bringing her meals, but when it was Crimson's turn, tragedy struck.",
                "Crimson mixed human blood into Elisabeth's food.",
                "If she'd been at her best, she might have noticed its scent before she ate it. Or maybe she would have eaten it but still been able to withstand her urges.",
                "But that was the day of the Red Moon.",
                "She had been without blood for too long, and she wasn't able to stop herself from going on a rampage. Crimson and his followers rose up in unison.",
                "Between the rampaging Elisabeth and Crimson and his men, it took them only a few hours to slaughter every human in the country.",
                "The vampires had seen humanity as mere livestock. There was no way they could live side by side with them.",
                "Elisabeth's dream, the Haven, had all been a mere fantasy.",
                "Because Elisabeth's followers had stopped drinking blood, they were powerless to resist, and they were slain as they fled.",
                "Mary was the sole survivor.",
                "In order to stop Elisabeth, she lapped up the blood of the dead. Then she pursued Elisabeth and the others all the way out of the country.",
                "Their fervor knew no bounds, and before the day was out, Elisabeth had destroyed yet another small country and torn its king limb from limb.",
                "Mary hadn't made it in time.",
                "Elisabeth's rampage lasted a full three days, and in that time, she dealt catastrophic blows to another three countries.",
                "Mary found Elisabeth the night after it was all over.",
                "Elisabeth was weeping as she gazed out on the countries she'd ravaged.",
                "\"Please, cast my ashes into the sea so I can never rise again and repeat this mistake...,\" she begged, then drove her sword into her own heart.",
                "She should have turned to ash.",
                "But she didn't. Her blade missed the vitals ever so slightly.",
                "Her heart stopped, and her lungs no longer breathed.",
                "It was like she was dead.",
                "Except she wasn't.",
                "If Mary placed human blood in her mouth, she would instantly be resuscitated.",
                "Alternatively, if she gave the sword a small push, Elisabeth would instantly turn to ash.",
                "Mary couldn't do either.",
                "She couldn't go against her master's will, but she couldn't bring herself to kill her, either. Instead, she hid her eternally slumbering queen in a coffin and vowed to protect her until the end of days.",
                "\"It was a foolish decision. A few years after that, Crimson snatched Queen Elisabeth away. Because I refused to drink blood, I wasn't powerful enough to protect her. Now, he's planning on using her again. I don't know how I could face her if I let the tragedy of a thousand years ago play out once more...\" Mary smiles sadly. \"But that's everything. I'm not human. I'm a vampire. And I'm sorry for keeping that from you...\"",
                "\"It's fine. I'm no different. See, I might be one of the possessed. A few years ago, these black bruises appeared on my back, and they just wouldn't stop spreading. But when I looked in the mirror one day, they were just gone. Poof. If those black bruises were the mark of the possessed, then eventually, I'll become a monster... That's why I forced my brother to come here with me. I wanted to get him into the Knight Order while I still can. But the moment I looked away, the enemy snatched him... I don't know how I'll be able to face him if anything happens to him...\"",
                "\"Ah...\"",
                "The two of them are silent for a bit.",

                "\"I see... Well, if you're not going to save her, I will. If we kidnap her and wait for the Red Moon to end, she shouldn't go on a rampage.\"",
                "\"But Claire...why go to such lengths?\"",
                "\"Once this is over, we can wake her up. Then you two can talk it over.\"",
                "\"But...I'm certain Queen Elisabeth just wants to die.\" Mary looks down in thought. All sorts of conflicts are welling up inside her.",
                "\"You won't know that till you ask. And it'd be too sad for things to just end like this. You'd be sad, Elisabeth would be sad, and all those dead people would be sad...\"",
                "Claire looks Mary in the eye and smiles.",
                "Mary's eyes are filled with hesitation. Deep down, she doesn't want things to end like this, either.",
                "\"Your Haven wasn't just some fantasy. That's what I believe anyway. Let's try and find an ending that has everyone smiling.\"",
                "\"I'm sorry...for putting such a burden on you.\" Mary looks back up and nods.",
                "\"Don't worry about it. Now, let's go beat up Crimson and kidnap your sleeping queen.\"",
                "\"Sounds good. And we'll make sure to save your brother, too.\"",
                "Claire stops in her tracks. \"I'm going to be the one to save Cid. Don't butt in.\"",
                "\"Uh, okay...\"",

                "\"Earlier, I told you the story of my mother and me. But that was not where the tale ends. When my mother went out to hunt, our village was attacked by a hostile tribe. Besides my three-tailed mother, most of the villagers had no ability to fight, so they fled. I hid under my bed, trembling. But my door was soon kicked down, and a group of men came into the room I was hiding in. They dragged me out, and oh, the vulgarity in their eyes... The moment I thought I was done for, another man came crashing through the window and cut the cruel men down. The man, who had sleek black ears and tail, was part of the reinforcement from our allies the Great Wolf clan. He introduced himself as Gettan, then held me tight to quell my fear. I was fourteen at the time, and he was seventeen...\"",
                "Yukime's clear eyes seem to gaze off into the past.",

                "After the attack, the Great Wolf clan helped rebuild her village.",
                "At the time, the great hero Shiva had just fallen, and the therianthrope lands were rife with conflict. The stronger clans were terrorizing the weaker ones, seeking power in order to succeed Shiva.",
                "Owing to the circumstances, it was only natural for people to want to form alliances to solidify their positions.",
                "As a result, it was decided that Yukime, daughter of the village's sole three-tail, and Gettan, son of the Great Wolves' patriarch, were to be married.",
                "Given her admiration for Gettan, Yukime agreed in a heartbeat. Her mother approved of him as well, in part because he'd saved Yukime's life, and Gettan held a great deal of affection for the fair girl, too.",
                "Although everyone gave the betrothal their blessing, the formal marriage was postponed until Yukime turned of age at fifteen.",
                "Until they were officially married, they weren't able to live together.",
                "Despite their living in different villages, however, Gettan came to visit Yukime all the time. The days they spent together were irreplaceable treasures for them both.",
                "They were the happiest days of Yukime's life, and although she was looking forward to the wedding, she also wanted them to go on forever.",
                "But peace has a short shelf life.",
                "There was a conflict between the major nearby tribes, and the Spirit Foxes and the Great Wolves got wrapped up in the conflict.",

                "Whoever they allied themselves with would forcibly conscript them, and whoever they made enemies with would retaliate. There were no good options. The Spirit Foxes and the Great Wolves talked it out among themselves, then came to a solution.",
                "They would make neither allies nor enemies of any of them.",
                "Their decision to fence-sit was made at the last possible moment. However, it was a foolish choice, one that utterly failed to take into account the cruelty of war.",

                "The ground was wet with blood as they burned.",
                "Gettan, the Great Wolves' strongest soldier, fought valiantly. In the end, all he was able to accomplish was escaping together with his fiancée.",

                "\"Like hell I was. I snuck up behind her and chopped her head clean off! If it weren't for that wench—!\"",
                "\"Gettan, don't tell me you're serious...\" Yukime took another step backward.",

                "Something smashed into Yukime's back.",
                "Then she collapsed facedown. Blood gushed from the sword wounds on her back.",

                "He even went so far as to save the incompetent members of the Dark Knight Association who were trying to hunt him down. What a truly magnanimous man he is!",
                "After Master Shadow saved them, they surely must have realized how small-minded they'd been and chosen to devote the rest of their lives to worshipping him.",
                "While Master Shadow was saving the petty lowlifes, the Blood Queen finished her resurrection! And who was it that stood against her? Why, the ravishing beauty with silver hair and an adorable little mole, Beta, of course!",
                "Realizing Master Shadow wasn't there yet, she decided to buy some time for him alongside her attendants!",
                "Her attendants got beaten black-and-blue, but Beta stood up to the Blood Queen and sacrificed her body to protect Master Shadow's sister.",
                "It goes without saying the world shed tears of gratitude for her noble sacrifice, and Master Shadow's heart must have been deeply moved, too.",
                "As proof of that, he immediately moved to cover Beta when he showed up, even though doing so dulled his movements dramatically!",
                "Master Shadow was forced into peril to protect his beloved Beta—but when things looked at their darkest she cried out!!",
                "\"I'll be fine... So go save the rest of the world!\"",
                "Hearing her laudable bravery got Master Shadow all fired up!!",
                "Not only did the power of love let him beat the Blood Queen in a flash, he even managed to bring her back to her senses!",
                "Afterward, the Blood Queen was so grateful to him that she promised to assist the Shadow Garden if they ever needed her help.",
                "As for Master Shadow, now that he'd saved both the world and his true love, he vanished once more into the night—!",
                "Now, it's easy to get caught up in Master Shadow's incredible strength, but his intellect is perhaps even more astonishing.",
                "His Shadow Wisdom allowed Mitsugoshi to grow rapidly, eventually becoming the largest company in the entire Midgar region.",
                "However, all the old merchants weren't going to take that lying down. Jealous of Mitsugoshi's rapid expansion, they all banded together and formed the Major Corporate Alliance!",
                "They were too late, though. Thanks to the power of Shadow Wisdom, Mitsugoshi was far more powerful than the MCA had anticipated.",
                "In order to combat Mitsugoshi Bank's paper money, the MCA developed their own currency. But because they had gotten a late start, they had difficulties getting people to use it.",
                "Those fools at the MCA had picked a losing fight, and it was only a matter of time before they went under. But we wouldn't learn who the true fools were until after everything was all said and done.",
                "It was around the end of fall when counterfeits of the MCA bills started showing up. Their bills were shoddy, so duplicating them would have been child's play.",
                "However, there was no way we could have known that Master Shadow has seen through everything and that the counterfeits were part of his master plan.",
                "Because of money creation, counterfeits posed a dangerous threat. Once their presence became known, a credit crisis would occur when the massed stopped trusting paper currency.",
                "Then, once people stopped trusting the MCA's bills, they would immediately stop trusting Mitsugoshi's bills in turn.",
                "When we realized that, we immediately opened an investigation into where the counterfeits were coming from so we could pin down our enemy. It was a man named John Smith, a master wire-user.",
                "We sent Delta after him, but he turned the tables on her and struck her down. Hearing about that came as an utter shock at the time, but thinking back on it now, it makes complete sense.",
                "Afterward, Alpha pursued John Smith to avenge Delta's death. When she did, however, we were confronted with yet another shocking truth: John Smith was none other than Master Shadow in disguise!",
                "Alpha returned, disheartened, then collapsed from the shock. And who could blame her? After all, she'd discovered that the man responsible for producing the counterfeits and trying to cause the credit crisis was Master Shadow.",
                "There was nothing we could do. If Master Shadow wanted Mitsughoshi destroyed, it was our job to stand by and let it happen. That didn't stop us from being stricken with grief, though.",
                "That brings us to the day before the crisis. After deciphering the code Master Shadow entrusted to us, we discovered that the truth was something none of us has considered!",
                "To our alarm, it turned out that the MCA was being controlled by the Cult of Diablos. They'd made their bills shoddy on purpose so they could produce counterfeits and cause a credit crisis.",
                "By figuring out their plan, getting the drop on them, and cashing in his own counterfeits to amass a huge amount of gold, Master Shadow gave Mitsugoshi the funds they needed to rise the crisis out.",
                "Upon learning the truth, we wept tears of joy and felt ashamed of our own foolishness. It was a magnificent, almost divine plan that only Master Shadow could have come up with!",
                "As he was beating up the Cult member who'd been manipulating the MCA, we went and used the gold he'd prepared for us to rise out the credit crisis and gain even more influence!",
                "That's all for Master Shadow's grand endeavors!",
                "In the next installment of The Chronicles of Master Shadow, through, we'll see fierce battles unfold in the Oriana Kingdom!!",
                "The Cult must be operating behind the scenes with on of their little schemes!",
                "We'll learn why Master Shadow has appeared before Princess Rose! And what dark secret does the Oriana Kingdom hold?! Also, the Knights of Rounds will finally make their move!!",

                "That training was by no means pointless. The proof of that is the fact that I'd immediately been able to sense magic, and that now I've become as proficient with it as with my own hands and legs. This feeling is just like that time when I had affixed myself to a cross while buck n.a.k.e.d... no, it is like when I had repeatedly converted religions and danced in prayer while buck n.a.k.e.d...

It's a lineage that has continuously spat out knights that fight while using magic to strengthen themselves –so-called magic swordsmen.

                "This could be easily seen just by watching any modern martial arts match. Useless techniques and unnecessary movements have all been weeded out, and different schools have taken and adopted other schools' very best. That melting pot effect was indeed bringing all those schools towards the path of being perfected.",

There are techniques that apparently only disciples can learn and are forbidden from leaving the school grounds. Even if a technique gets publicized, there is no media to spread it. In other words, there is no melting pot, no selection, no polishing. If I had to sum them up in a single word, it would be \"crude.\"",

                "For example, physical strength. People can lift someone else up with a single hand. Just because of that, all grappling techniques become obsolete. Even if I mount someone, they can jump into the sky just by flexing their abdominal muscles. Even if I put someone into the guard position, they can send me flying with just a single leg. So yea, grappling techniques, all out the window.",

                "Martial arts are, in essence, a fight over maai. Distance, angle, positioning, these are all what the fights are all about.",
                "It took me quite some time to determine my own maai in this world. I mean, this world's people's maai are so far away. They start fights standing 5m away from each other. Sure, their step in is long, and their speed is fast, so it's not like I don't understand. At first, I was impressed with it and thought \"ohh so this is this world's fighting style\"... but nah, turns out that it's only because their defense techniques are undeveloped.",
                "We have this kind of people in our world too –people who suck at defense so they just meaninglessly distance themselves from their opponent as much as possible.",
                "The opponent's attack is scary, isn't it? Being in a place where their attacks can't reach you is safer, isn't it? So that's why fights become just blandless repetitions of opponents dashing in to make an attack before dashing right back out. Hit and run, is it? Sorry, useless and simple back and forth movements don't count as hit and run.",
                "To me, 5m and 100m is equally worthless. After all, proper attacks can't be launched from either distance. 6m, 7m, 10m, it's all the same. There's no point to it, so let's just walk closer together and close the distance, shall we?",
                "But at a certain distance, there is enormous meaning between the difference of 1mm, which is maai. Whether my attacks will hit, whether my opponent can react in time, considering the angle and various other things, gaining or losing advantage by moving half a step sideways or tilting a certain degree. By no means is it just running 5m to make an attack before jumping backwards 6m.",
                "All my preconceptions about another world and magic and all that confused me for quite a while, but recently I was finally able to determine my own maai, so all's good, I suppose.",
                "So yea, that's pretty much how my daily training at home goes. There's only me, my older sister, and my dad –my dad teaches my older sister and me, and my older sister and I spar. My older sister of 2 years above seems to have quite the talent, and will most likely become the heir of the house. In this world where magic can be used, even girls can become crazy strong, so girls becoming the heads of their families is not that uncommon.",
                "And because of that, I get beaten up by my sister pretty much every day. I mean, I can't win, right? After all, to become a power in the shadows, I have to act out my common life as an unremarkable Mob A.",
                "Which is why I spend everyday going \"fueee, onee-chan you're so strong~\" while getting beaten up.",
                "So, such is my daily life. During the daytime, I also have studies related to being a noble, as well as various other tasks that I need to carry out as Mob A, so I don't have much free time.",
                "Therefore, my personal training naturally ends up having to be carried out at night, after everyone else has gone to sleep. Of course, that means decreasing my sleeping hours, but by combining the effects of meditation and magic's recovery powers, I was able to develop a unique sleeping style that is super short but super effective.",
                "Well then, let's work hard at training today as well. For today, I have a bit of a special menu after the usual running in the forest.",
                "As of late, it seems that some ruffians have taken to occupying a nearby abandoned village. Upon investigation, they turned out to be a bandit gang of quite some size. Yep, they make for perfect tameshikiri targets.",
                "I do kill random scattered brigands whenever I come across them, but something the level of a full-fledged bandit gang is like a once in a year event for me, so I'm quite excited. All year long I'm in lack of a proper sparring partner, so I love these kinds of criminals. Aah, can the local public order go down please?",
                "In the rural areas of this world, criminals can generally be killed without a trial. More like, only the large cities have judges, so those in the rural areas aren't too fussed up about this kind of thing. Which is why I will judge you all, kekeke.",
                "Today is to commemorate a new weapon that I have recently been trying out –the slime bodysuit.",
                "Allow me to explain what the slime bodysuit is.",
                "This world has magic. This world's people fight by using that magic to strengthen themselves and their weapons. However, there is always some degree of loss when they use magic. For example, a normal iron sword would only have 10% efficiency –you pour in 100 points of magic, but the effect is only a boost of 10 points. Which means that 90% of the magic is lost in the process. Even for mithril, a metal lauded for its high conductivity, a sword capable of 50% efficiency would already be considered to be a high grade item. So in short, there is always a huge amount of loss.",
                "Then I came to consider slimes. Slimes are, well, true to their appearances, magical beings. They change form and move around using only magic. When I studied them further, I realized that their magical conductivity is a mind-shattering 99%. Furthermore, as they are in liquid form, they can freely change form. So I hunted slimes, crushed their cores, and experimented on the leftover slime jelly. The number of slime cores that I have crushed are easily in the thousands. It was to the degree where the local area began suffering from a slime deficiency, forcing me to go on expeditions further afield.",
                "The slime jelly was quite easy to process. After strengthening and compounding it, I was eventually able to make a full-body bodysuit out of it. Unlike armor, it does not make any sound, is comfortable, and actually even provides support to any movements I make. And of course, its defensive capabilities are also guaranteed.",
                "At the moment, I'm wearing a completely black bodysuit made from slime jelly mixed with black pigments. There is no unnecessary adornments, the suit fits my body perfectly, and my vision and breathing is unobstructed. I pretty much look exactly like the villains in a certain detective manga.",
                "Perhaps I should also think of a more appropriate design in preparation for the day when I shall intervene as a power from the shadows.",

Then it would require about a week for her own higher ups to give permission for the investigation. Then 3 more days to get back to Lindwurm. Then she would have to wait for Nelson to process the request, which can take as long as he wants it to. Based on her judgment of his character, he would probably get around to it after a week. But with that much time loss, naturally all evidence and witnesses and of course the culprit would be long gone.",
                "But with that said, as a representative of the country, she cannot push too forcefully. The Church spans the entire continent, so if Alexia antagonizes the Church, the surrounding countries would definitely come to pressure Midgar Kingdom. Above all, she, and the royal family by extension, would lose the citizens' support. Religion is extremely convenient as an ally, but makes for an extremely troublesome opponent.",

She represses her inner self to put on a performance as the perfect princess, that is how she lives. Those who stand above others all do this to some degree or other, but very few take it as far as she does.

                "However, within such an era, Elizabeth was the only one who disapproved of feeding on humans more than necessary. She hunted only enough to sustain herself, and did not indiscriminately take lives. There were many vampires very vocally opposed to her way of life. Thus, despite her great strength, she only had very few subordinates.",
                "But then the times turned, and it became the age of darkness for vampires.",
                "It was a nightmarish age where humans hunted vampires. The fall of the first vampire monarchy triggered an explosion of revolts, causing the population of vampires to plunge in the blink of an eye.",
                "At that time, Elizabeth was serving as feudal lord over a border domain within a small kingdom, helping to protect that border and country. She and her subordinates joined hands with the humans living there in farming, in hunting demon monsters, and in managing the land.",
                "Within her territory, vampires did not look down on humans, and humans did not fear vampires. The reason why they were able to build and maintain that relationship was because the vampires there had sworn off human blood.",

However, she managed to keep at it, constantly suffering pain akin to her arm being gnawed through. And her subordinates also followed suit.",
                "These vampires who stopped feeding on blood gradually lost their powers, until their strength was reduced to that of normal humans.",
                "However, in exchange, they gained something.",

Their population started to bounce back, humans and vampires co-existed, and their land prospered. Due to the combined influence of her own strength and the parent country's support, even vampire hunters stopped appearing in her territory.",

It was not until the establishment of the Great Commerce Alliance that people's deposits started to be used by these firms as sources for loaning out money. However, the number of deposits is still small. So, most of the banknotes issued by the Great Commerce Alliance come from their own funds.",

                "Incidentally, as The Mitsugoshi Co. continued to introduce new products, new demands would rise, the people would spend their money at the Mitsugoshi Bank, and would then distribute their banknotes in exchange for their customers money, allowing the flow of goods would circulate. The kingdom would flourish with the unprecedented prosperity in the economy and the growth of investment. Which would then lead to people taking out more loans for their businesses, and that would then lead to the Commerce Alliance needing to do the same to compete, but they would not have the funds to give out such loans.",

As they have already deposited their money at the Mitsugoshi Bank, and only a few people were willing to move their money to the Alliance.",

However, it is possible to manipulate the timing of when the Alliance goes bankrupt by planning when to circulate the counterfeit bills into the market. In doing so, the Alliance will no longer have the funds necessary to exchange for banknotes or to support their firms. The people will lose their trust in the Alliance, and when that happens, the people will want to withdraw their funds from the Alliance. At the same time we can exchange our counterfeits for real cash, further depleting the Alliances finances.",
                "Large scale workshops for producing counterfeit notes would stand out, but Yukime had a base in Outlaw City that could serve as a cover. The less time needed for the Alliance to go bankrupt, the lower the risk of their counterfeit operation being exposed. And by the time the Alliance knows of it, they will have already collapsed, and a large sum of money will have already made its way into Yukimes hands.",

If they can't exchange the alliances notes for theirs as well, they will go bankrupt too, after that we will have a lot of cash leftover.",

If not for the defects in their brains they would have dominated this world.",

No, every time, in the beginning, the victor was the beastkin. However, the supply line extends vertically and would withdraw when starved. The same pattern every time.

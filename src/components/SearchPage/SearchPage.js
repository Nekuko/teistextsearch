                "I honestly can't remember what catalyzed this desire. All I know is I've admired shadowbrokers for as long as I can remember.",

                "Was it a certain anime? Or was it a manga—or a movie? Eh, I guess it doesn't matter. I was all in for anything that featured a mastermind, or an eminence in shadow as I like to call them. These characters were never the protagonists or final bosses but were relegated to a role behind the scenes where they flaunted their powers and meddled in the affairs of others. I've always looked up to the men in the shadows. I wanted to be one of them.",

                "Think of children who worship their favorite superheroes. That was me but with master puppeteers.",

                "Well, there was one thing that set us apart: My reverence for them wasn't short-lived. In fact, it buried itself deeper in my heart, never dying out and always guiding me through life. To become stronger, I learned everything from karate to boxing, from swordplay to mixed martial arts. I hammed it up during all my practices, concealing my true power from the world and preparing for the fated day.",

                "At school, I played the part of being pleasantly mediocre, an unassuming face in the crowd. Like an NPC in a game or a part of the mob. I didn't do any harm. But behind this facade of normalcy, I was training full throttle. That's how I spent my entire youth.",

                "But as time passed, an uneasy feeling started to haunt me: I was due for a reality check.",

                "Yeah, that's right.",

                "This was all for nothing.",

                "I realized I'd never become as powerful as shadow commanders in the stories. It didn't matter how hard I trained in martial arts. Sure, I could clobber a few punks... but that was it. It'd be a tough fight if anyone drew a gun, and if I was surrounded by soldiers in full gear, I'd be toast, donezo, old news.",

                "The idea of a shadowbroker getting curb stomped by some soldiers... Ha! Ridiculous! Let's say I trained for ten more years—or that I became the greatest martial artist in the world. I'd still get rekt by a gang of commandos.",

                "Or maybe I'd manage to escape by the skin of my teeth or train hard enough to fight back. It's all in the realm of possibility. But even if I somehow managed to do that, these guys could set off a nuke and vaporize me in an instant. There is a limit to the human body. That much I know.",

                "That said, my master puppeteers would never be taken down by a nuke. Which means I needed to be impervious to them, too.",

                "What does one need to survive a nuclear attack?",

                "Is it the ability to pack a punch?",

                "Could it be a body of steel?",

                "How about unlimited stamina?",

                "Wrong, wrong, and wrong again. You need a totally different kind of power.",

                "Some call it magic. Others, mana. Or chi, or aura, or... you get the point. Anything will do. I needed to obtain this clandestine ability. I'd managed to reach this conclusion when I finally confronted reality head-on.",

                "I'll try to explain. Let's say someone is on a quest for magical powers. Anyone would think they're nuts. Hell, I know I would. I'd think they'd gone bonkers.",

                "But consider this: No one in the world has proved that magic exists—or disproved it.",

                "I couldn't find these powers with my sanity intact. I had to dive to the depths of lunacy.",

                "I started training in a new way that was damn near impossible.",

                "After all, no one knows how to acquire magic, mana, chi, auras, or what have you.",

                "I practiced Zen meditation; I braved the purification ceremony of standing under waterfalls; I focused my entire being inward; I fasted; I mastered the art of yoga; I converted religions; I searched for holy spirits; I prayed to god; I strapped myself to a cross. There was no right answer, which meant I groped my way through the darkness and sprinted down my chosen path.",

                "Which brings us here. I'm just about ready to start my final summer as a high schooler, and I've yet to discover magic or mana or chi or auras...",

                "It is already dark by the time I finish my daily training session.",

                "I pick up and put on my underwear, which I'd chucked to the side, and wiggle my arms through the sleeves of my school uniform. I have yet to pick up these secret magical skills, but I've been starting to feel the effects of my training, I think, of late.",

                "Like right now.",

                "I can see flashing lights going off in my mind and sense the world is spinning.",

                "It could be magic... or auras... In either case, I'm feeling its effects—that's for sure. I'm proud to announce that I've completed another successful session.",

                "When I'm in the thick of it, I rip off every single article of clothing and get buck naked in the forest. It makes me one with the universe. I bash my skull into the trunk of a giant tree to physically force out my worldly thoughts. Plus, it stimulates my brain and urges my latent powers to awaken.",

                "You know, I'm all about logic when it comes to these things.",

                "Yeah, everything's beginning to get all blurry right about now. It's a sensation comparable to giving myself a concussion. I make my way out of the forest with the lightest of footsteps, feeling like I'm treading on clouds.",

                "Just then, I see light—two beams floating in the air and slicing through space. How strange. They're beckoning me, guiding me somewhere.",

                "\"Ma-magic...?\" I whisper, tiptoeing toward the illumination.",

                "It must be... It's gotta be! I finally found the powers of the unknown!",

                "I notice that I've gone from walking to sprinting, tripping over the roots of trees and continuing to stagger forward—on and on like a beast in the forest.",

                "\"Magic! Magic! Magic! MAGIC, MAGIC, MAGIC!!!!!\" I chant, bounding toward the lights and ready to snatch them out of midair...",

                "\"Hmm...?\"",

                "As a pair of headlights flood my vision with a blinding whiteness, I hear the shrill whine of a sudden brake ringing and ringing.",

                "And then a collision. Its impact pierces through my body... And my magic...",

                "In conclusion, I was able to find magical powers.",

                "When I open my eyes, I sense that I'm surrounded by its energy, though I gotta admit it looks different from the two lights. Eh, no biggie.",

                "Oh, and one other small detail: As a side effect, I manage to reincarnate. I bet I opened a door to another world when I found magic or something. Whatever.",

                "As for right now, I'm a baby boy, a few months old. I only recently started forming thoughts, but it's still hard for me to guess how much time has elapsed at any given moment. Plus, I don't know any words, but I guess it's plenty to recognize that this civilization is more or less the same as Europe in the Middle Ages.",

                "But none of that's important. I've acquired magical powers. That's the end-all be-all. I couldn't care less about how it happened or any bonus features.",

                "I notice magic as soon as I start displaying glimmers of consciousness. All around me, I can see minuscule grains of light floating and shimmering. It reminds me of those times in my past life when I frolicked through a field of flowers stark naked—to train and find spirits, obviously.",

                "As it turns out, my training wasn't a total waste after all. I mean, my ability to detect this energy is proof enough, and I can control it as easily as my limbs. It's comparable to when I strapped my naked body to a cross, a nod to Jesus... or maybe when I flip-flopped religions and danced around in prayer in my birthday suit... I bet every little thing in my training sessions helped me in the long run. It's already taught me that I can get stronger.",

                "Plus, time is of no consequence for a baby. I'm ready to use these years to train and become an eminence in shadow, once and for all... Oops, I think I've made a doodie.",

                "Which reminds me. I heard somewhere that birds let their droppings dribble out involuntarily, and I think human babies are the same. I can fight the good fight with logic and reasoning, but it feels as though my instincts take over, whispering Just do it in my ear.",

                "That said, this is me we're talking about. I spent my waking hours training in my past life. Pooling together all the strength in my body, I tighten my sphincter, buying me some time...",

                "\"Wwwaaaahhhhh!\" ...to summon people.",

                "I think it's been ten years.",

                "You know, magic is something else. It means I can surpass the bodily limitations of humans: lift ginormous boulders with a single finger, dash twice as fast as a horse, leap higher than a house.",

                "That said, I'm no match for nukes. Well, I know my defenses will increase with my magical capacity, but have you seen the firepower of those weapons on Earth? There was a time when I contemplated forgetting about them entirely, 'cause we don't have nukes in this world.",

                "But what good is a master puppeteer who settles for less?",

                "No good. Not at all.",

                "That means my next mission is to become strong enough to beat weapons of mass destruction. After extensive research and training, I found one potential solution, which I've been incorporating into my daily experiments.",

                "Oh yeah. And it seems I've been born into a noble family. For generations, members of this family have trained to become dark knights, who use magic to power up and slay enemies in battle. And as my family's rising star of a son (...NOT), I'm living my days as your average apprentice. After all, shadowbrokers need to be extremely selective about when, where, and to whom they reveal their powers. Yeah... I'll lie in wait until then.",

                "I know I'm not exerting my true potential and that I am cutting corners, but I learned some skills as an apprentice that have come in handy. Like how magic is used on the battlefield in this world. It's been a good opportunity for me to reflect on my own techniques.",

                "To be completely honest, it's clear to me the fighting styles from my past life were a hundred times more logical and refined than the ones here. I mean, look at any contemporary martial arts battle. These fighters rebuke unnecessary movements, drawing from various combat schools and whittling them down to the cre me de la cre me. This creates the conditions for the \"perfect\" fight. It relies on the rules of the game, of course, but this mental attitude can be used to identify the best of the best in any situation.",

                "And then consider this world. First and foremost, their fighting techniques stay in their country of origin. Which means different schools of combat don't cross borders. Plus, there are certain secret skills that countries won't allow out of their jurisdiction—not that we'd be able to spread them to begin with, since no forms of media are readily available to us. This means we can't combine techniques from other forms of fighting, much less reject or improve our own.",

                "If I had to describe this system in one word, I'd call it unrefined.",

                "But there's one fundamental difference between the two worlds. That's right: magic. It completely changes the baseline of physical performance.",

                "Take physical strength, for example.",

                "I can lift someone up with one hand, which means any knowledge about hand-to-hand combat and wrestling, or \"ground fighting,\" goes out the window. Even if we're in a mounted grappling position, I can soar through the air by flexing my abs. If I've got my foot hooked on an opponent in an offensive guard, I can blast them off me by activating my leg muscles. Yeah. Ground fighting is out of the question.",

                "It's like how humans have their method of combat and gorillas have a breed of their own. And I'll just leave it at that.",

                "There are also differences in the distance and speed at which combatants step into their attacks—meaning it's harder to predict their movements in battle. This might be the most important thing. I mean, martial arts are all about reading your opponent at an appropriate range. The angle, position, and distance of your attacks are everything.",

                "It took me a while to get the hang of the last one, especially because these fighters attack from afar. Like sixteen feet apart. I mean, I guess I get it. They're lightning fast and take ginormous steps, and I'd just assumed this was their way of fighting... until I realized it was to compensate for their poor defense tactics.",

                "I'm sure this is relatable to all martial artists: Those who can't guard will stand too far from their opponents.",

                "It's really scary to get hit. I get it. It's tempting to retreat to where your opponent can't reach you. But this results in a contest where one fighter attacks and the other retreats, and vice versa, which is a real snore. You call this outboxing? Try again. This is just an exercise of running back and forth.",

                "It doesn't matter if the fighters are five or a hundred meters apart. They can't land a decent hit either way. It could be six or seven or ten meters—it's all the same.",

                "This has been a public service announcement to close the gap and duke it out.",

                "But once you cross a certain threshold, one millimeter can make a huge difference. And it stands at the exact point where I can both land a blow and react to an attack. Throw in other factors like the angle of my hits, and the slightest turn can mean an advantage—or a disadvantage. The narrowest of margins is the best range between two fighters.",

                "A battle shouldn't be about one combatant dashing in sixteen feet and the other leaping back nineteen.",

                "I guess I came into this whole thing with an idea of what to expect from other worlds, which—compounded with my unfamiliarity with magic—left me confused about their combat scene. But, eh, I've gotten my bearings straight as of late. It's all chill now.",

                "I train every day at home, where our dad basically directs us on how to throw down, and I grapple with my older sister. I know she's only two years older than me, but she has natural talent, according to everyone else. If she keeps it up, she's the one who will take over as head of the family, which isn't uncommon in this world, since magic can make women powerful enough to become the heir.",

                "\"Geez, you're so strong...,\" I whimper every day as she kicks my ass.",

                "But I can't win. If I want to become a shadow commander, I've got to establish myself as the most average of all background characters.",

                "That's how I've been living out my day-to-day. Tack on lessons about how to act as an aristocrat and hanging out with people to secure my place as a low-profile extra, and I've barely got any free time during the day.",

                "Which means the only time for me to train is after everyone else has gone to bed, late into the night. I may be cutting into my beauty sleep, but I've been using magic to recover super-quick and meditation to catch some z's in new ways. And now, I've pretty much got short sleeper syndrome. I make it work.",

                "Okay, time to get down to business. I blast through my usual training regimen in the forest. I've got something special planned today.",

                "I heard that rogues have taken up residence in the ghost town nearby. According to my investigation, it's a large gang of thieves—and the perfect opportunity to test my new weapon.",

                "I take down bandits here and there. But a whole group of criminals? That's the event of the year. And I'm always short on sparring partners, so I welcome evildoers with open arms.",

                "Oh, please, please, please infest this place with more crime!",

                "I think it's standard for villages to try to deal with offenders on their own terms, but they mostly get away scot-free. I mean, our judicial system is in the city, which is why I've decided to take the law into my own hands.",

                "Today marks the historic day of my first official battle with my newest weapon. I've been experimenting with it for months and call it the \"slime bodysuit.\"",

                "Allow me to explain.",

                "We can use magic in this world to strengthen our bodies and weapons, but there are energy losses when it's transferred from one form to another. For example, if I run one hundred currents of magic through an average steel sword, only 10 percent of them will be of use in combat. A whopping 90 percent is lost. Even a mithril sword, which is known to be compatible with magic. It's considered high-end if it performs at 50 percent capacity.",

                "That's when slimes caught my eye. A slime is a magical being that uses energy to change form and wobble from place to place. According to my research, I've found they have a conductivity of an astonishing 99 percent. On top of that, they're in a liquid state, which means they can change their shape at will.",

                "I started testing slime jellies after capturing and crushing their cores—easily more than a thousand of them. In fact, I pushed them to the brink of extinction in my area by killing too many and had to go on an expedition to find more.",

                "The jellies are easy to handle and strong, to boot. I successfully molded the slime into a wearable bodysuit, which is super-lightweight and silent, unlike armor. Plus, it almost, like, supports my movements? And I've given it killer defenses, of course.",

                "As for right now, I'm wrapped in a black slime bodysuit. It's a simple, no-frills getup that fits my body perfectly, except for eyes, nostrils, and mouth. I'm virtually indistinguishable from the criminal in a certain famous detective manga.",

                "I might want to think up a more suitable design when I'm intervening in a scheme as a full-fledged shadowbroker.",

                "I manage to arrive at the ghost town late into the night, but I can see a few lights in the darkness. The thieves seem to be having a feast to celebrate their robbing of merchants.",

                "Wow, I'm super-lucky.",

                "You see, thieves aren't good at planning, and they immediately squander what they steal, which means they only have something decent right after a successful attack. And one man's treasure is another man's treasure. What's theirs is mine. This is how I'll get the funds to become a puppet master.",

                "Anyway, I crash their feast, excited as all hell—not with a surprise attack, because that won't make for a good practice session.",

                "\"Yahoo! Hand over the loot, scumbags!\" I shriek in the middle of their banquet.",

                "\"Wh-who the hell is this puny dude?!\"",

                "I mean, I'm only ten years old. Like, duh. It's only natural that I'm short.",

                "\"You heard me! Now fork over the goods!\" I shout, punting the rude man across the room for calling me small.",

                "The other thieves finally draw their weapons.",

                "\"Hey, keep it up, and we ain't gonna hold back, you bra—...!\"",

                "\"Take that!\" I exclaim as I slice through his neck, severing his head from his shoulders midsentence.",

                "That's right. My sword is made of slime, which means I can draw it from my bodysuit when the situation calls for it. And it has a bunch of nifty functions.",

                "Number one. It can elongate.",

                "\"Take that! And that! And that!\" I extend my sword and slay all the dinky thieves in the vicinity.",

                "I stretch the slime out in the shape of a whip with edges as sharp as a sword. It's my first time wielding it, so I'm a tad nervous, but I can totally see how it might come in handy.",

                "\"And that! And that! And... huh?\"",

                "I notice the room has gone all silent as I get a little too carried away with slashing and slicing around me.",

                "Wait, is there only one guy left?",

                "\"Wh-who are you...?\"",

                "\"Eh, I guess you'll be my guinea pig for function number two.\"",

                "\"Th-the hell do you mean...?!\"",

                "\"To break it down, you look stronger than the rest of them. I'm assuming you're like their boss or something, right? Your chances of winning are squat, but if you let me practice on you, I bet you'll live for, like, two extra minutes. Good luck.\"",

                "\"S-stop playing, you brat! In the capital, I'm the—...!\"",

                "\"Hey, you. Skip the speech and come at me.\"",

                "\"Die, dammit!\" booms the Boss (or whatever) as he closes the distance between us, taking his sweet old time to swing at me, and I obviously... don't budge.",

                "His sword plunges straight into my chest, and I'm thrown to the ground on impact.",

                "\"Ha-ha! That's what you get for messin' with me! I've mastered the Royal Bushin method, and... Wh-what?!\"",

                "\"Ta-daa!... You couldn't even scratch me.\"",

                "I rise to my feet as if nothing happened, and wow, I couldn't be happier with my suit's defenses! I mean, these weak-as-shit attacks can't even touch me.",

                "\"I've heard it seems to be all the rage in the capital. Show me.\"",

                "\"Damn you!\" swears the Boss as he strikes me.",

                "Yeah. No sweat. As he swings his sword with all his might, I don't even ready mine, sidestepping and ducking to dodge him, no problem.",

                "The Royal Bushin method, was it? I could get into their ways of wielding the sword.",

                "I mean, it's not every day you get to see someone fighting over something other than spirituality, old-fashioned standards, or personal beliefs in this world. This was a fight motivated by logic. I can see it from his clumsy set of attacks.",

                "In the length of a second, a small step forward.",

                "I see him calculate his next strike and take creative approaches. That said, his attacks leave a lot to be desired, and in the next free moment, I step just out of his range.",

                "\"Wh-why... why can't I hit you?!\"",

                "\"I mean, you're weaker than my old man. Though I guess you're stronger than my sister. Not that it means anything. And I bet she'll whup your butt in another year.\"",

                "\"You little shiiiiiiiiiiit!\" he screeches, frantically bashing his sword in my direction.",

                "I parry his advances before kicking him lightly in the shin—snapping my leg forward quickly as though on reflex.",

                "\"Gwah, ah! Why...?\" the Boss whimpers, curling into a fetal position and clutching his leg.",

                "Blood drips from his shin and pools on the ground.",

                "It's a cheap trick, you know. I have a blade as sharp as an ice pick sticking out from my toes.",

                "The second handy-dandy feature of the slime sword is that I can wield my blade from wherever and whenever I want. I thought this tactic showed the most potential. All I have to do is get in front of the enemy and slash him with the sword in my shoe, since lower-body attacks are hard to block. I parry hits, lock blades, and give my opponent a kick.

                "\"Claire Kagenou, has your physical condition... felt off recently? As in, has it gotten harder to use and handle magic? Have you experienced any pain when you use it? Is your body starting to turn dark with rot?... Do you have any of these symptoms?\"",

                "\"Did you abduct me to play doctor?\" The corners of Claire's glossy lips lift to a smile.",

                "\"You know, I used to have a daughter. I don't want to knock you around more than I already have. Answering honestly would benefit us both.\"",

                "\"Is that a threat? When I feel threatened, I tend to get hostile... even when I shouldn't.\"",

                "\"Are you saying you won't tell me the truth?\"",

                "\"We'll see.\"",

                "Grease and Claire glare at each other for a while.",

                "She's the one to break the silence. \"Fine. I'll answer your dumb question, since it's no big deal. What was it? About my condition and magic, right? Well, everything's fine now. If I wasn't chained up, I'd be doing pretty darn good.\"",

                "\"What do you mean by 'now'?\"",

                "\"Well, I first noticed the symptoms a year ago.\"",

                "\"What? Are you saying it got cured—on its own?\" Grease has never heard of a case where it healed on its own.",

                "\"Yeah, I didn't do anything to... Oh, right. What was it? A 'stretch'? I don't know what that means, but my little bro asked me to stretch with him, and I felt better after that.\"",

                "\"Stretch? I've never heard of that before... but if you had symptoms, that means I wasn't mistaken in thinking you're compatible.\"",

                "\"Compatible...? What does that mean?\"",

                "\"Nothing that should concern you. Either way, you're going to break soon enough. Oh, and I'll make sure to look into your brother...\"",

                "Before he can finish his sentence, he suffers a blow to the nose.",

                "\"Wha—?!\" he barks, stumbling back to the door and glowering at Claire. He holds his bloody nose. \"Claire Kagenou, you wretch...!\"",

                "All four limbs should have been bound, but she somehow managed to free her right arm, where blood trickles down her wrist.",

                "\"You scraped off your own flesh and dislocated your finger...?!\"",

                "These are no ordinary chains. They're sealed with magic. In other words, she unleashed the full extent of her physical strength to slice the flesh off her hand, break her own bones, and slide out of the chains to punch Grease. This rattles him to his core.",

                "\"If you do anything to my brother, I'll never forgive you! I'll kill you, your loved ones, your family, your friends... Ngh...?!\"",

                "Grease clobbers Claire in the gut with all his might. There's no way she can defend herself from his spells, especially when she's strapped down by chains.",

                "\"You bitch...!\" spits Grease as she crumples to the ground.",

                "On the floor, there's a pool of dark-red blood fed by a trickle from her right hand.",

                "\"Well, then. I'll know when I've used this...,\" he murmurs, reaching out to touch her blood when a winded soldier flings the door open.",

                "\"Viscount Grease, we're in trouble! Intruders!\"",

                "\"Intruders?! Who the hell are they?\"",

                "\"We don't know! There are only a few of them, but we don't stand a chance without you!\"",

                "\"Ugh, I'll take care of it! The rest of you, stay on guard!\" Grease clicks his tongue in irritation before turning on his heel and making his way from the cell.",

                "By the time Grease arrives on the scene, the area is already smeared with blood.",

                "The soldiers who protect the major facility aren't weak by any means, and some even rival the royal guard.",

                "\"Why? This can't be...!\"",

                "Illuminated by a single light streaming in from the outside, countless dead bodies litter the ground of the underground hall in the facility.",

                "Each bears a single slash—sliced by an unimaginably destructive force.",

                "\"Son of a bitch...!\"",

                "Grease glares at a group of figures dressed in black bodysuits. From their curves, he can guess they're petite girls—seven in total. Under the dim light of the moon, they're stealthy enough that it's easy to lose sight of them without a concerted effort. These women are using a rare technique to control their magical presence, and Grease recognizes this group might just rival him in strength.",

                "There's one who's drenched in blood, eyeing him under the moonlight.",

                "\"Nnr...!\"",

                "In this moment, instinct overtakes Grease—not for any explicit reason, but he can sense danger.",

                "Blood drips down her bodysuit and onto the floor, and she lets her katana drag behind her apathetically, creating a trail of gore.",

                "\"Who the hell are you? What's your purpose?\" he asks, attempting to suppress his unease.",

                "But he's faced with seven rivals as powerful as him. To fight would be asinine. Grease curses his bad luck as he searches for a way out.",

                "The blood-splattered girl isn't listening to him. She laughs, snickering from behind her bloodied mask.",

                "She's going to hunt me down...! Grease thinks, just as he hears another voice.",

                "\"Back off, Delta.\"",

                "The girl halts in place before retreating without resistance. Grease lets out a huge sigh of relief.",

                "Another girl walks forward to take her place.",

                "\"We are the Shadow Garden.\"",

                "If they were anywhere else, her angelic voice would have entranced him.",

                "\"I'm Alpha.\" He realizes she's revealed her face at some point, and her pale skin gleams under the moonlight. She steps forward.",

                "\"Nn...!\"",

                "He sees she's an elf with golden hair and beauty that leaves him gasping for breath.",

                "She takes another step.",

                "\"Our purpose... is to eliminate the Cult of Diablos.\"",

                "He doesn't take notice of her black sword until it slices through the air and parts the night sky. Or at least, it seems to create that illusion, and Grease is overcome with intimidation by the force of her swing and the wind that follows it.",

                "How did she acquire such power at this age? He trembles with jealousy and fear—but more than anything, he's petrified by her declaration.",

                "\"How... how do you know our group?\"",

                "The Cult of Diablos. Grease is one of the few people in the facility who knows the name of this organization.",

                "\"We know everything. We know all about Diablos the demon, his curse, and the heroes' descendants. And... the truth about the possessed.\"",

                "\"H-how did you...?\"",

                "Grease was only recently informed of this top secret information, which couldn't—No, shouldn't have been leaked.",

                "\"You're not the only ones after the Curse of Diablos.\"",

                "\"Ksh...!\"",

                "He knows he can't forgive them for getting access to classified information. But would slaying them prevent it from spreading?",

                "No, no good.",

                "Which means he needs to live—to survive to inform headquarters about the girls, which is why Grease moves forward.",

                "\"Aaaaaaaaagh!!\" he shouts, unsheathing his sword and swiping at Alpha.",

                "\"How reckless,\" she notes, dodging and countering it with ease.",

                "Her blade grazes his cheek, where blood pours from the fresh wound.",

                "And yet, that doesn't stop him. He continues to pursue victory, even as none of his attacks land. Grease misses by a hairbreadth each time.",

                "On the other side, Alpha is focused on eliminating unnecessary movements and calculating the trajectory of his sword to sidestep oncoming assaults.",

                "And all the while, Grease's arms are slashed, legs cut, shoulders sliced.",

                "But none of his wounds are fatal.",

                "Grease sneers when he realizes she won't kill him until she gets intel out of him, and a new path to victory comes into view. After he slices through nothing again and again, he's finally slashed in the chest, causing him to retreat.",

                "\"Let's not waste any more time,\" says Alpha.",

                "Grease doesn't answer, kneeling and clutching his wounded chest. A smile then spreads across his face... and he swallows something.",

                "\"What... are you doing?!\" His body doubles in size—his complexion darkens, his muscles bulge, his eyes glow red. And most importantly, his magic capacity increases... dramatically.",

                "\"Unnh...!\"",

                "Grease's steel sword zings through the air without warning, which Alpha manages to block instantly. But she grimaces on impact, using the momentum to leap back and create distance between them.",

                "\"Interesting trick,\" she notes, shaking her arm as pins and needles shoot through it. She cocks her head to the side. \"Based on the wave frequency, I'm guessing it's a magical overload... that's been forcibly induced...\"",

                "\"Lady Alpha, is everything all right?\" asks a voice from behind, surprised to see Alpha back down during a fight for the first time.",

                "\"It's fine, Beta. Just a messy situation... Hmm?\"",

                "When Alpha turns her gaze back to Grease, there's no one in sight. Well, more accurately, there's a rectangular hole in his place, leading to a lower level of the facility—a trapdoor.",

                "\"...He got away.\"",

                "\"Yeah... let's go after him,\" Beta responds, ready to leap in behind him.",

                "Alpha stops her in the nick of time. \"That won't be necessary. He'll take care of it.\"",

                "\"He...? Now that I think about it, Master Shadow said he'd go ahead of us... No way.\"",

                "\"Yeah. I have to admit I was worried he'd get lost when he sprinted down a different route.\" Alpha giggles.",

                "\"He knew this would happen... He's done it again.\" Their eyes glow with respect as they peer down the hole together.",

                "\"I'm lost,\" I mumble to myself in an empty underground facility.",

                "It was all fine and well when we infiltrated the hideout, but I got sick of fighting off small fry. I thought I'd go ahead and kill their boss, which brings us... here. Bummer. I mean, I even practiced what I'd say when I faced their leader and everything.",

                "Anyway, this place is huge. I get the vibe of a group of bandits living in an abandoned military facility.",

                "\"Hmm?\" I sense someone running toward me from the other side of the tunnel. It takes a few beats before the figure notices me, too, leaving a wide gap between us.",

                "\"You've been expecting me...,\" he assumes.",

                "He's super-jacked, and his eyes have a crimson glow for some reason or another. He looks... really friggin' cool. I can imagine him shooting laser beams with his eyes.",

                "\"But if it's just you, this should be a breeze,\" he remarks with a twisted smile on his face.",

                "Then he vanishes—well, more like moves fast enough that an average person would've thought he disappeared.",

                "But I parry his attack with one hand. As long as I can spot the course of the attack, I'm not scared by the velocity of the assault. Even power is all about how you use it.",

                "\"Nnr!\" he yelps.",

                "I push him away in the shoulder and retreat.",

                "His magic is incredible—much stronger than Alpha, if I'm being honest. But his command over it is dismal, unfortunately. He's nothing but a dope jacked with magic.",

                "I'm not a big fan of people who go bananas with their magic, getting yoked with spells and moving at unimaginable speeds, and I don't like relying on physical force. Not that I'm trying to reject it. I mean, if I was forced to choose between strength and technique, I'd take strength in a heartbeat, since advanced tactics without the power to back them up are useless.",

                "That said, I absolutely despise half-baked strategies that solely depend on physical abilities—like power alone, or speed alone, or reaction time alone. They overlook and disregard the subtleties of battle.",

                "You see, strength is natural, but mastery requires effort. Shadowbrokers never lose when it comes to skill and expertise. And I want to be the same. My techniques will bolster my strength. My ingenuity will dictate speed. My reaction time will let me scope out potential attacks. Physicality is important, but I'd never screw up a fight by relying on it. That's all part of my battle aesthetic.",

                "If I'm being honest, this hulky slugger is starting to piss me off.",

                "Let's teach him a lesson... about the right way to use magic.",

                "\"Lesson one.\"",

                "I wield my slime sword and walk forward—one step, two steps, three.",

                "On that last one, he takes a swing at me, which means I'm in his fighting range and is my cue to speed up. I take the tiniest quantity of magic possible, focus it in my feet, compress, and then release it in one shot. That's all there is to it, and you can create an explosive impact with the smallest magical force.",

                "His sword slices through the air.",

                "And now he's in my range.",

                "I don't need speed or power or magic. I graze his neck with my ebony katana, slicing through the topmost layer of skin and leaving the veins untouched.",

                "I back up. His blade scathes my cheek at the same time.",

                "\"Lesson two.\"",

                "I make my move as he readies his sword again. I don't use magic, letting his movements stay quicker than mine. But he can't attack and move at the same time—no matter his speed.",

                "Which is why I can get closer and take one tiny step.",

                "It's a distance that's too long for me and too short for him.",

                "There's a moment of silence that follows.",

                "I see him looking uncertain of his next move, but he ultimately chooses to back away.",

                "I knew he was going to do that, based on the shift of magical energy inside him, and I close the distance before he has a chance to back up.",

                "This time, my sword scrapes against his leg, cutting a little deeper than the last laceration.",

                "\"Gah...!\" He groans in pain and continues his retreat.",

                "I don't pursue him.",

                "\"Lesson three.\" I'm just getting started.",

                "Have I ever felt this overpowered before? Grease wonders as the ink-black sword continues to break skin.",

                "Even when he fought Alpha the elf, even when the princess claimed victory at the Bushin Festival, Grease didn't feel weak. In fact, the last time he'd felt a power imbalance... was when he was a kid. It was the first time he'd ever held a sword and squared off with his mentor—an adult versus a child, a champion versus a novice. It was hardly anything that could be considered a fight.",

                "Grease is experiencing that same feeling right about now.",

                "The boy in front of him doesn't look tough whatsoever. At the very least, he doesn't emit the same menacing aura as Alpha when Grease fought her. He's a total natural; his stance, magic, and swordsmanship all seem to come effortlessly. In fact, his strength and speed are unremarkable, honestly—nothing special at all. But his strategy perfects his swordplay. And he manages to stand against Grease's powers of mass destruction using that alone.",

                "Which makes Grease feel an overwhelming sense of defeat.",

                "He knows the only reason he's alive is because the boy allows it. If his opponent wanted it, Grease would be dead in an instant.",

                "But Grease could regenerate his body as long as he didn't suffer fatal wounds. Of course, there are limits and nasty side effects. Meanwhile, he's shed pails of blood and had his bones broken, his flesh shredded, which means he'll need more time to fully recover.",

                "But even in this time of crisis, Grease survives.",

                "No. It's more accurate to say he's been spared.",

                "Grease lets out a single question: \"Why...?\"",

                "Why are you letting me live?",

                "Why are we enemies?",

                "Why are you so strong?",

                "Why?",

                "The young boy shrouded in black looks down at Grease. \"Lurk in the darkness and hunt down shadows. That's the only reason we exist.\"",

                "There's a distant sadness to his voice.",

                "And that's all it takes for Grease to understand the situation.",

                "\"Are you going up against them...?\" he asks.",

                "There are certain people in this world who the law cannot touch. Grease knew this and considered himself above that threshold—special concessions, privileges, and those with hidden personas. After all, the light of the law doesn't shine to the very edge of the world.",

                "While Grease enjoyed certain privileges, he was trampled and crushed by those at the top, which made him yearn for more power... and led to his downfall.",

                "\"Even if you... Even if your gang of twats becomes stronger, you'll never defeat them. The darkness of this world... is a deeper abyss than your wildest dreams,\" he says—not to warn the boy but to express his diabolical hopes.",

                "Grease wants the boy to get pulverized, lose everything, and become totally disillusioned with society. But, overcome with petty envy and spite, he frets that this wish is out of reach.",

                "\"Then we dive deeper,\" offers the boy without a hint of eagerness or ambitiousness.",

                "But Grease can sense his steadfast resolve and unshakable confidence.",

                "\"It's not easy.\" Unacceptable.",

                "Utterly unacceptable, thinks Grease, who's doomed for attempting to take them down himself.",

                "This is the moment he decides to cross the final frontier. He removes a pill from his breast pocket and swallows it whole when he realizes he's not going to survive. If that's the case, he thinks, I'll use this life to teach him the truth.",

                "The truth about the darkness of this world.",

                "The aura surrounding Grease changes.",

                "Until now, his magical energy had been rampaging around his body, but it starts to withdraw, replaced by its densely compressed twin. His veins rupture and burst with blood, his muscles tear, his bones shatter—but his body heals instantly. He defies the physical limitations of a human form and hosts an immeasurable amount of magical power.",

                "The Cult calls this the \"awakening.\" Once one assumes this form, there's no turning back.",

                "But in return... one is bestowed with Herculean strength.",

                "\"Aaaaghhh!\" Grease roars in a beastly fashion before vanishing into thin air.",

                "The dull sound of impact hangs in the air. In the same moment, the boy in black is flung off his feet toward a wall, which he kicks to shift his body and land on the ground.",

                "But Grease continues swinging at him, propelling the boy back again.",

                "\"Too slow! Too flimsy! Too frail! This is reality!\" Grease aggressively hounds him.",

                "With another thump, the boy is catapulted backward by more of Grease's attacks—quick, heavy, and merciless. It's all because he possesses an overwhelming force.",

                "Grease thinks he has it all figured out: The tiger doesn't have to be cunning to kill a hare. He just needs strength. By pushing back, it makes it impossible for the boy to fight—and he's destined to fall apart.",

                "But this is all wrong.",

                "\"Hgh?!\" Grease whines as blood erupts from his chest.",

                "He takes notice of a laceration—one that breaks past the surface of his skin. Grease halts in place for a split second, but he recovers fast enough to knock his enemy back in the next instant.",

                "\"It's hopeless! You can't get me!!\" he shrieks, even as his flesh is shredded down to his bones.",

                "But his wounds begin to bubble up and heal in the next beat.",

                "\"This is true power! This is true strength!!\" Grease starts to accelerate, slashing his weapon through the air, even as blood spouts from his body.",

                "He appears as a flash of scarlet light.",

                "Ebony and crimson—the two colors clash, causing the one in black to get slung back and the one in red to spew fresh blood.",

                "Their battle is too quick for the human eye to catch, and the afterimage of crimson and the backward movements of ebony are the only indicators of something uncanny in the making.",

                "Their skirmish doesn't last long. There's a clear power imbalance, and it's easy to guess that the figure in black would be the one to break. It's a fight that the one in red shouldn't have lost—slinging his sword on repeat and pulverizing the other into submission with his cataclysmic strength.",

                "But why?",

                "Why does he look unfazed...?",

                "\"Why... why can't I hit you...?\"",

                "The boy in black hasn't changed from the beginning of the fight. He's barely unleashed any magic or moved on his own accord, instead choosing to go with the flow and let Grease fling him around. It's as if he's a fallen leaf swept away in a rapid stream.",

                "Except he's not completely passive. He uses the momentum of these blows to land a direct hit—without seeming showy or expending any unnecessary energy.",

                "It's natural. As if it's supposed to happen.",

                "\"Terrible,\" states the boy in black, staring down Grease and looking as if he can read his thoughts.",

                "\"You know nothing... Nothing, you bastard!\" Grease barks back, pooling every bit of magic into his body and sword before taking his shot.",

                "He's ready to eliminate this boy, even if it costs him his life, raring for the biggest assault of his existence.",

                "\"No more games.\" Grease is sliced in two—by an unconstrained swing of a sword. It's hurled down on him with the ease of a walk in the park. A singular stroke bisects it all—his sword, his enhanced magical powers, his muscular physique.",

                "The viscount thought the reason behind the boy's advanced swordplay was pure skill—not magic, strength, or speed. But he's wrong.",

                "The boy in black has everything at his disposal. But he chose not to use all of it until now.",

                "I found my sister totally unconscious, so I undid her chains and left her there, which contributed to her crankiness when she returned home the next day. But she's a real tough cookie—tough enough that the wound on her hand almost healed overnight.",

                "After a hectic week or so of hospital treatments and follow-up investigations, my sister finally made her way to the capital—though she pestered me more than usual during that time for some annoying reason.",

                "The girls in the Shadow Garden were busy, conducting their own research, taking care of the remaining bandits, and other stuff. Oh, right, we're not calling them bandits. Whatever. The Cult. I mean, they're all thieves in the end.",

                "But that geezer with red eyes was outstanding. I mean, he inspired me to come up with \"then we dive deeper,\" which sounds like something a shadowbroker would say. I owe him my thanks. I would've loved to have him play a supporting role to my part as an eminence in shadow.",

                "This was a must-see performance. My ability to improvise and portray a master puppeteer was off the rockers. It's a real shame there wasn't a live audience. But I only have to wait two more years—which is when I go to the capital. You know the one. It's a world-famous metropolis and the only city in this country that houses one million people.",

                "I bet protagonists are a dime a dozen, and there might be Final Bosses, too.",

                "There's bound to be conspiracies, rebellions, and incidents—none of which would ever happen in the boonies. And that's when the mastermind bursts onto the scene... Huh. Now that I think about it, I guess I'm just a toad who feels cocky about beating some bandits. At this moment in time, my prologue hasn't even been written.",

                "And then one day, Alpha and the other girls gather before me, just as I'm yearning to get stronger for school, which is two years down the line. They want to share their reports on the Cult and lab findings on the curse and all that jazz.",

                "It's unusual to have all seven of them in a room at once, especially since it seems they've got their hands full as of late.",

                "Geez, go easy on the research and investigations. I mean, it's all pointless anyway, I think as I listen to their reports.",

                "Here's a simple summary of their findings.",

                "Their first claim is that the heroes who slayed Diablos the demon were all women, which is why they're the ones who suffer exclusively from the curse.",

                "How creative. But I hate to break it to you that all the heroes were men in the most common theory. Oh, wait, I bet they came up with that since the Shadow Garden is comprised of seven women apart from me.",

                "Their next report was on how the curse was most common among elves, followed by hybrid beasts and then humans. According to their research, it has to do with the life spans of the respective species. With humans living short lives with weak traces of the heroic bloodline, they're least susceptible to the curse. On the other hand, elves have long life expectancies with potent concentrations of blood, which makes them the most prone to fall victim to the curse. The therianthropes, or hybrid beasts, are in the middle.",

                "Now that I think about it, I'm the only human in the Shadow Garden, and I've never been possessed. Besides me, we have two therianthropes and a posse of five elves—and all seven have been possessed. You know, they did a stellar job coming up with this backstory.",

                "And then they proceed to report on a bunch of other things, which I pretend to absorb.",

                "They move on to their reports about the Cult, which is supposedly a massive organization that operates on a global scale. Fascinating.",

                "In terms of being the possessed or cursed or whatever, they tell me the Cult calls them \"compatibles,\" and their members are supposedly going the extra mile to locate, acquire, and wipe them from existence or some crap.",

                "Anyway, they suggest that the Shadow Garden scatter across the world to prevent this from spreading. Their plan would leave me with one rotating subordinate, the rest of them scattering to every corner of the world to protect the possessed, investigate the Cult, and sabotage their activities.",

                "When they suggest this new plan, it hits me all of a sudden: They must have realized that the Cult doesn't exist.",

                "They're through with this stupid charade and demanding their freedom. What else could scattering across the world mean? I'm guessing they feel indebted to me for curing them, which is why they're going to stick with me on a rotating basis. I just have to deal with it. I know that's what they're trying to tell me.",

                "I'm bummed out. In my past life, the kids idolized the heroes as much as I adored masterminds—until we grew up, and they didn't even notice that they'd forgotten all about their precious heroes. I was left alone. I guess the girls have grown up, too.",

                "I'm feeling all soppy but agree to send them on their way. I never planned on having seven members to begin with. If they leave me with one subordinate, that's enough for me. I see them off, and we reluctantly exchange good-byes.",

                "I make a vow to myself: I'll never stop trying to become a mastermind, even if that means I have to face this world alone.",

                "She no longer fears killing others.",

                "Beta whips her inky katana, splattering congealed blood off her blade and onto the ashen ground in a clean line. She stands cloaked in the darkness of night and surrounded by a group of soldiers lying facedown.",

                "\"End him,\" orders Beta.",

                "The girls in black bodysuits pierce their blades into the guard. One of their hands in particular shakes violently, but it doesn't stop the girl from thrusting her sword into his pressure point.",

                "\"Guh... Gaaaah!\" shrieks the soldier with his final breath, causing her blade to freeze in place.",

                "It's the type of cry that'll haunt her in her sleep until she becomes accustomed to killing.",

                "Beta envelops the girl's hands on the helm with her own before giving the blade a sharp twist. Together, they feel the soldier's life leaving his body.",

                "\"Ah, ahhh...!\" gasps a voice.",

                "This time, the cries are the girl's.",

                "Beta wraps her arm around her subordinate's trembling shoulders and issues her next instructions. \"Secure the target.\"",

                "It's still breathing.",

                "\"Return to Lady Alpha—fast.\" They haul the mound, carrying it tenderly, and start to pick up speed, followed by the member of their order previously nestled in Beta's bosom.",

                "Beta squints slightly, watching them go.",

                "She's raising them well.",

                "These girls used to know nothing about combat. They'd never held a sword, and it goes without saying that they'd never murdered anyone before meeting her.",

                "Beta is reminded of her own past, and old memories begin to resurface.",

                "She still remembers how it felt when she killed for the first time—her sword piercing their heart, their hand grabbing hers. Beta couldn't believe the strength of their grip even as they suffered a fatal wound.",

                "\"There's a short period of time when people can move after they've been stabbed through the heart. Don't let your guard down. Hey, Beta, are you listening?\"",

                "Beta was listening to Alpha's calm voice but couldn't understand what she meant for the life of her.",

                "She was paralyzed with fear—incapable of moving or thinking.",

                "\"You're impossible.\"",

                "Those words sounded so cold.",

                "Beta was a child who had trouble doing things on her own.",

                "After joining the Shadow Garden, she always followed Alpha around. After all, they were old acquaintances, and she knew she would go down the right path if she stuck by Alpha's side.",

                "But Beta couldn't find a reason to fight by following Alpha's footsteps—or understand the importance of finding said motivation. As a result, she couldn't get used to the idea of murder, vomiting violently after killing someone on a mission and shaking in fear every night as she tried to fall asleep. It wasn't unusual for her to wake up screaming in the middle of the night.",

                "On one particular evening, Shadow approached the tormented girl.",

                "\"Do you seek wisdom...?\"",

                "\"Y-yes?\" Beta answered all jittery as she cocked her head to the side.",

                "In her eyes, he was enigmatic and extremely powerful.",

                "\"If you seek wisdom... I shall give it to you.\"",

                "He might mean the knowledge of easing my emotional turmoil from murdering others, she thought.",

                "With great expectations, Beta nodded. \"I—I want wisdom.\" Her voice trembled.",

                "\"Then I shall give it to you...\"",

                "Shadow began telling a story. \"Once upon a time, in a faraway place, there was an old man and an old woman...\" It was an ordinary fairy tale—no smidgen of wisdom or anything else.",

                "What the heck?",

                "She wasn't sure how to respond—not that she was brave enough to oppose the one revered by Alpha—and shut her trap to listen to his story. It was more interesting than she'd initially imagined. In fact, she realized she'd been so absorbed in the tale that she'd forgotten the time.",

                "That evening, Beta had a deep, peaceful night's rest.",

                "And ever since then, Shadow recited a bedside story to Beta before she went to sleep.",

                "Beta had always been a bookworm, but she'd never heard any of his tales before. They were gripping and original to her ears. Time flew by as she listened to them, and she'd be fast asleep in no time—and stopped jolting awake in the middle of the night. Her favorites were \"Cinderella\" and \"Snow White.\"",

                "This may have been around the time Beta began chasing Shadow with her eyes.",

                "She noticed she was spending more and more time around him. At first, she observed him with a timid gaze. But after a year had passed, Beta was attached to him at the hip.",

                "Shadow was indispensable to the Shadow Garden—absolute strength, knowledge, and wisdom. His unconditionality comforted Beta. Soon enough, she found he'd become a necessity to her, too.",

                "She realized her doubts had disappeared somewhere along the way.",

                "Without Shadow, Beta would have been killed for being possessed.",

                "She'd been disowned by her family, chased out of her home country, and this series of tragedies made Beta slow in processing her new situation. She'd lost too much to notice her gains.",

                "With her skepticism gone, Beta was able to realize something: Shadow had given her a new life and strength.",

                "She could feel this truth swelling in her heart.",

                "Beta had found a reason to fight.",

                "She began keeping a journal to write about him every day—for her to keep in touch with her memories and feelings, for her to never doubt anything again.",

                "Beta had found a reason to live.",

                "At first, she'd jotted down words and adjectives, but she noticed it had turned into sentences, and that flourished into a story somewhere along the way.",

                "The faint sound of movement brings Beta back to reality. She unsheathes her sword before approaching the loading deck and peers under the wagon.",

                "\"S-stop...!\" Beta swings her sword down without hesitation, and blood squirts out of his neck as he sprints for his life.",

                "He staggers a few more steps before collapsing to the ground. Swiping the blood spatter off her cheek, Beta gazes at the night sky, where a full moon peeks out from between the clouds. Under the moonlight, she smiles innocently—as if she's a lovely flower fraught with danger in the night.",

                "Beta has no doubts.",

I've heard of others using magic to force their muscles to loosen up, but this still affects their performance.",

It's nice to seethe strongest fighters value their fundamentals. Plus, all the students are skilled. I can say it's a neat environment—and I'm not trying to suck up or anything.",

                "And most importantly, the techniques taught in this class are hyper-logical. It feels great to take part in training that doesn't leave me bored out of my mind.",

                "\"Yeah, but my contributions are nothing compared to Princess Iris's. In any case, the Royal Bushin method practically raised me, which is why it makes me happy to see others enjoying it, too. Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you.\"",

                "With that, Mr. Zenon goes to check in on the other students. I totally understand his feelings. I mean, I get all giddy when Alpha and the other girls watch me show off my swordplay.

                "She strikes, and I guard.",

                "We don't hit each other, moving at a sluggish pace, and skimp on magical energy. All around us, the other pairs are locked head-to-head in all-out fights, blasting each other with spells. But to my surprise, Alexia is matching my pace.",

                "No. That's not it... This is normal for her. After all, the purpose of this activity is to review our strategies, meaning that speed and power are pointless. Alexia is focused on this goal—and that alone. I can tell by the way she handles her sword.",

                "This entire country sings the praises of Princess Iris, Alexia's older sister—brilliant and fiendish, the strongest combatant in the kingdom. On the other hand, they don't have much to say about Alexia. She possesses magic and forthright techniques, but she's inferior to her sister. That's what people generally say when talking about Alexia.",

                "But as I spar with her, I think she's good. She adheres to the basics and grasps the foundations of combat, though it feels uninspired.",

                "Yeah, it's run-of-the-mill. But that's the fruit of her labor: Her swordplay is polished, refined, and devoid of all excess. That's the proof that she's mastered the basics step-by-step.",

                "Delta, you could learn a thing or two from her, I think, engaging in a fake conversation with a certain hybrid beast—one whose swordsmanship I find hard to forgive.",

Its entire body is distorted and bloated, and its right arm is longer than Alexia's legs. In contrast, its left arm is thinner and stumpier than hers, and there is a protrusion in its body as if it is carrying something in its stomach.",

                "The creature is right next to Alexia.",

                "Her hands and feet are chained to the table, but it's only bound by its neck. If it were to just extend its long arm, the monstrosity could potentially touch her.",

But Alexia hasn't spent all those days training with her head in the clouds. In her mission to become as strong as her sister, she's realized her own shortcomings and worked hard to make up for them.

                "This place is unbelievable. It'll take the world by storm. It's only a matter of time, I'm certain.",

                "We walk through the staff door and down a passage to a humongous stairway. I swear I've seen it in a certain movie about a luxury cruise ship. We ascend the stairs and continue walking through a bright and spacious hallway. At the very end of the hall is a large, sparkling door carved with exquisite engravings.",

                "Two lovely ladies stand in front of the door. They bow to me and open it slowly.",

                "What lies beyond is a space that looks like an enormous hall. There are tall pillars that resemble those in ancient Greek temples and marble floors that glisten under the light.",

                "A red carpet has been unfurled, extending to the back of the room and flanked by two rows of attractive women.",

                "\"Huh?\"",

                "The moment I set foot in the room, they all kneel simultaneously.",

                "\"Um... So how about that survey...?\"",

                "An enormous chair has been positioned in the backmost part of the room. A crimson sunset pours down from the skylight and onto that delicate masterpiece.",

                "The seat remains empty.",

                "A lovely blue-haired elf stands next to it. She's a refined woman with a model-esque figure covered by an entrancing black dress. I know that face.",

                "\"We've waited a long time for you, my lord.\" Another woman stoops down to one knee with the elegance of an actress.",

                "\"Gamma...\"",

                "She's the third original member after Alpha and Beta. Anyone can tell she's a genius by taking one look at her clever face and sharp blue eyes. That's Gamma, the brains of the Shadow Garden.",

                "Gamma is clever, I give her that. But she has one major flaw.",

                "Her nickname is Gamma the Weak.",

                "Even though she's one of the longest-serving members in the Seven Shadows, Gamma is the weakest by far. To backtrack, the Seven Shadows refers to the first seven members of the Shadow Garden. I chose that name because it's badass. Obviously.",

                "When it comes to fighting and physical activities, Gamma's instincts are fatally poor. If Delta is the most talented fighter in the Seven Shadows, Gamma is the worst. I personally think the two of them are similar. If I said that out loud, I bet Gamma would blow her fuse and Delta would tremble with mirth, but I know for a fact they're the same type of person.",

                "I learned two things when I was teaching Gamma and Delta how to fight.",

                "One: Intuition is wasted on an idiot.",

                "Two: Intelligence means nothing without intuition.",

                "At that point, I decided to try giving them the same instructions: \"Infuse your slash attack with a bunch of magic.\" And that's all.",

                "I was suggesting they physically pummel the shit out of their enemy—which is the brutish method I find absolutely abhorrent. That's right; my core beliefs crumbled before this duo without pomp or circumstance. If I even think about that day, I get a headache. Yeah, let's not go there. Forget about it.",

                "\"Nice to see you again, my lord.\" Gamma gracefully walks toward me like a model on a runway.",

                "Her hips sway salaciously as I listen to the heart-stopping tap, tap, tap of her heels against the floor.",

                "\"ZOINKS!\" She trips and falls over nothing.",

                "\"Th-these heels are too darn tall.\"",

                "And she blames it on her shoes.",

                "Gamma clutches her nose as she rises to her feet. Meanwhile, the women around her break into a lightning-fast whirlwind to produce shorter pumps.",

                "\"W-well, then. Come this way, Master,\" Gamma continues as if nothing happened, sauntering forward in totally different shoes.",

                "But I don't really mind. There are only two ways to react when a girl embarrasses herself: either pretend not to notice or go all out and tease her. Even though I'm in the former camp myself, there's something I have to say.",

                "\"Your nose is bleeding.\"",

                "The girls around her hastily wipe the blood away.",

                "\"R-right this way, my lord.\"",

                "I glance at Gamma's burning-red cheeks. She hasn't changed a bit.",

                "She escorts me to the giant chair, where I take a seat. The view is... fantastic.",

                "Mighty fine, indeed.",

                "There's a big and open space where a scarlet glow tumbles in through the skylight, and two rows of hotties are kneeling beside the red carpet. It's as if I've become king—the king of the Shadow Realm. Gamma must have spent a fortune preparing this set for me.",

                "My heart is pumping. I'm moved to the core. I cross my legs, rest my cheek in my left hand, and raise the other, focusing my blue-violet magic into my palm and shooting it into the heavens.",

                "It almost blasts into the ceiling before it dissolves into a myriad of lights that flood the entire room.",

                "\"Receive your reward...\"",

                "There is a downpour of light, falling upon the kneeling girls and temporarily dyeing their skin a bluish violet. It only replenishes energy, promotes magic circulation, and heals minor wounds... In other words, nothing much.",

                "\"I'll treasure this day forever.\" Gamma's voice wavers as she kneels at my side. Her performance is very convincing.",

                "But she isn't the only one trembling. All the lovely ladies on both sides of the long red carpet are quivering, and some are even weeping. The employee who brought me here sniffles through her tears. Gamma is the perfect director for her troupe of actresses.",

                "\"You've done well, Gamma. By the way, I have a question about this company.\"",

                "Yes, back to business. From the chocolate to the products on the sales floor to the architectural design of the building—I can't imagine them coming from this world.",

                "\"Ask me anything.\"",

                "\"Is this Mitsugoshi merchandise based off my stories?\"",

                "Gamma has always been interested in picking my brain for some reason. Every time Delta beat the living shit out of her, she would pester me in tears, begging me to tell her a story. That was when I told Gamma about my Shadow Wisdom, which included randomly embellished stories about chocolate and the other goodies in Japan from my past life.",

                "\"Yes, my lord. I've only re-created a fraction of the divine knowledge that you've imparted unto me.\"",

                "\"I s-see.\"",

                "I only told her she could make chocolate by throwing together bitter beans and sugar and waiting till it hardens. Calling that knowledge is overkill. And how did she re-create all this? This must be what it means to have a brain. I mean, she's eons smarter than me.",

                "But that doesn't bother me. The world has its fair share of geniuses and idiots. That's all there is to it.",

                "But I do have one question.",

                "\"Do Alpha and the others know about this company?\"",

                "\"Of course.\"",

                "Oh, I get it.",

                "They've fallen into their usual shindig of leaving me out. I understand if it's hard for them to include the only guy here in their clique of girls, but come on.",

                "\"A-and have you been making money?\"",

                "\"Right now, we have shops in every major city both domestically and abroad. Our business is expanding at a rapid pace. But how long will we be able to hide in the shadows under the guise of a company? This is the most important consideration.\"",

                "What's with the cheesy, slipshod setup? It's unnecessary. Just get to the point!",

                "Basically, she's telling me that everyone is raking in dough from my knowledge. Everyone but me. If they just gave me a teeny-tiny portion of it, I wouldn't have scrounged for cash or chased down coins like a dang dog.",

                "Whatever, it's fine. The girls have prepared this huge prop for me, so I can't complain.",

                "But if I could just have a little slice of the pie.",

                "\"Um, I hope you don't mind me asking this, but could I borrow a few zeni?\"",

                "I'll pay her back someday... maybe.",

                "\"Yes, I'll prepare it right away,\" Gamma responds quickly.",

                "She gives orders to the woman who brought me here.",

                "A few moments later, a wheelbarrow full of coins rolls into the room, as tall as a mountain. I've never seen this many sparkling coins in one place. This is easily over a billion zeni.",

                "\"Th-this is a bit...\"",

                "I can't borrow all this. I could never pay them back.",

                "\"—gh! Is this not enough? I'll send for more right aw—...\"",

                "\"No, it's fine.\" I stop Gamma midsentence and reach toward the coins, making a big show of thrusting my hand into the mountain.",

                "The coins loudly clink together.",

                "Now I've got their attention locked on my right hand. I concentrate with all my might.",

                "\"Hmph!\"",

                "I take about fifteen coins in my right hand and show it to everyone in the room, before slowly putting it into my right pocket. I've just gotten one and a half million zeni richer.",

                "And I have another one and a half million zeni in my left pocket, too.",

                "While focusing their attention on my right hand, I snatched some coins in my left at top speed, stuffing them into my pocket before anyone could notice. Alpha or Delta might have picked up on it, but Gamma never stood a chance.",

                "\"I-is that it? You can have all—...\"",

                "Watching her is hilarious to me. She thinks I'm only borrowing one and a half million zeni, but I actually pocketed three million!",

                "\"That's enough for now,\" I say, holding back laughter.",

                "\"All right. Take this back.\" Gamma claps, and the gaggle of women roll the wheelbarrow away.",

                "Gamma kneels before me. \"My lord, I think I know why you've come today. It must be about the incident.\"",

                "\"Yes.\"",

                "I nod. What incident?",

                "\"My sincerest apologies. We're currently investigating the matter but haven't caught the culprit. Please be patient. I'll hunt down the slasher in the capital—the fools in ebony, pretending to be in the Shadow Garden.\"",

                "\"Hmm...\"",

                "This is the first I'm hearing about this.",

                "\"Hmm...\"",

                "Gamma gazes at Shadow as he trails off and begins contemplating. Somewhere in her blue eyes, there's a hint of unease.",

                "A tear streams down from the corner of her eye without warning. Seeing those blue-violent rays reminds her of her past.",

                "Gamma's life began with a light of the same hue.",

                "If he'd never come, she would have died a rotting mound of flesh. She was abandoned by her family, chased out of her home country, stripped of everything in her possession. She fell into an abyss of pain and fear and disappointment—and the one who rescued her was the boy who produced the blue-violet light. She would likely never forget that glow for her entire life. To Gamma, it represents the light of survival.",

                "Alpha once told Gamma there was life in it, and Gamma agreed, not for logical but for instinctual reasons.",

                "It didn't just heal external wounds—but a much deeper part of the soul. When she touched the bluish light, it was as if she was released from her shackles, liberated from something holding her back. She finally felt like she had reclaimed her identity.",

                "On that day, she was reborn. The moment she received the name Gamma, she vowed to devote her new life only to him.",

                "While her intentions were sincere, she was the least powerful member of the Seven Shadows. She was defeated and surpassed by newer members, left crawling on the ground and deeply humiliated. Somewhere along the way, Gamma realized she couldn't beat her peers. It didn't matter how hard she trained.",

                "She was in anguish. What was she worth? She would rather die than display her stupidity and bring everyone down. But he randomly called out to her the day she planned to end it all. And he imparted his Shadow Wisdom to her.",

                "That insight showed her how to fight with her intelligence over strength, and she dived headlong into his ways. And since she thought this was her only chance at survival, she literally put her life on the line to re-create his Shadow Wisdom.",

                "When Gamma looks back on it, she's certain he recognized her pain—that he shared his knowledge because he knew she was hurting and had foretold the path she would walk in life.",

                "It made her feel forlorn. It saddened her to know he was out of her reach.",

                "Does Shadow need me? Tears well up in her eyes whenever she thinks about it. But that's why she needs to wipe the tears away and keep fighting.",

                "She'll make the Shadow Garden bigger and stronger, a more suitable organization for Shadow... and on that day, she believes her wish is certain to come true.",

                "\"I see. Very interesting.\" His voice pulls Gamma back to reality. \"I think I know who did this. I'll take a look around.\"",

                "Gamma's chest tightens when she hears his omniscient tone.",

                "She'd failed to help him once again. He could surmise the correct answer with a snippet of information. Even if she mobilizes all her subordinates, he could easily find hints she never could.",

                "But Gamma refuses to give up. One day, he's bound to notice her... so she has to persist.",

                "\"Nu, come forward.\" Gamma calls over the dark brunette who brought him here. \"This is Nu. She's number thirteen.\"",

                "\"Wow.\"",

                "He peers at Nu through narrowed eyes. His gaze seems sharp enough to see to the depths of her power.",

                "\"Even though Nu only just joined us, even Lady Alpha has recognized her for her strength. Feel free to use her as a liaison, for chores or whatever you like.\"",

                "\"I'm Nu. It's a pleasure to meet you.\" Her voice trembles slightly from nerves.",

                "\"I'll call you if something comes up.\"",

                "\"Understood.\" She bows and steps back.",

                "\"I guess I'll be going now.\" He stands. \"Oh, almost forgot. I'd like to buy some chocolate —the cheapest kind. If you could give me a friends and family discount, that'd be great.\"",

                "\"We prepare our best chocolate in-house.\"",

                "\"Um... how much will that be?\"",

                "\"With the friends and family coupon, that'll be one hundred percent off.\"",

                "\"One hundred percent... That makes it free! Yippee, it's my lucky day! In that case, I'll take three of 'em.\"",

                "\"Thank you for your business.\"",

                "The three of us sprint down the pitch-black streets of the capital.",

                "I'm definitely one of the two reasons we're late. But Skel's and Po's constant questions about that lady are the other reason. Nu—was that her name? Either way, I just batted away their interrogation with a bunch of maybes.",

                "That said, I never would have pinned Alexia as the type to become a real-life serial killer. If Delta's not the culprit, it's got to be Alexia. I knew it was her the moment I heard about the recent crimes. She's a princess who has it all. What could have possibly set her off...?",

                "The woman's heart is an enigma.",

                "You know, I don't look down on mass murderers. That's a way of life. But sullying the name of the Shadow Garden is a whole different story. Those unfortunate souls won't be getting away with this.",

                "\"Hey, did you hear that?\"",

                "\"Nope, nothing.\"",

                "Skel and Po are running ahead of me as they talk between themselves.",

                "It doesn't seem they heard it well, but to me, it was crystal clear.",

                "It was the sound of two blades colliding, which means people are fighting nearby.",

                "But why is this guy impersonating the Shadow Garden?",

                "That is the obvious next question, and I know the answer all too well. I can fully understand him, because I am who I am.",

                "The answer is adoration.",

                "This man is enamored by the Shadow Garden... and secret masterminds. I can't say I blame him. I mean, my whole journey began because I loved shadowbrokers. I fell in love with the hidden commanders in movies, anime, and manga and started imitating them.",

                "This impostor walked that same path and found the Shadow Garden. Yes, he's the Shadow Garden's first follower in the world.",

                "But this is unforgivable. Why? Because I'm a mastermind. If I forgive those who tarnish my organization's name, then I no longer am one. Right now, we can both call ourselves shadowbrokers, and I won't stand or settle for that.",

                "Rose Oriana is stunned by the boy who keeps getting back up no matter how many times she knocks him down.",

                "He's soaked in blood, and no one can tell if he can lift up his sword. He doesn't look like he can fight—No, it's a miracle he can even stand.",

                "Although her sword is thin, her attack certainly isn't light. The tip of her blade may be blunt, but the magic inside of it is real. If she got one decent shot, he'd be rendered useless.",

                "But... exactly how many times has she hit him?",

                "It wasn't just once or twice. Even though he endured at least ten strikes, he still rises to his feet with unrelenting vigor.",

                "How is he still standing after all that? His body has exceeded its physical limits, but his eyes seem devoid of death.",

                "His fierce gaze tells her he still has something left to do.",

                "That's right. His soul surpasses the limitations of the body, and his unyielding soul is holding his broken being together.",

                "His valor leaves a deep impression on Rose. How badly does he want to win this battle and why? He must have a reason he can't allow himself to lose.",

                "There is an immense difference in skill. He doesn't have so much as a one-in-a-million chance, but even then, he refuses to give up.",

                "His fiery eyes glare at Rose.",

                "It isn't over yet. This isn't the end.",

                "Rose is moved that the tenacious spirit of a hero can defy death in the face of an undefeatable opponent. She has great respect for him, offering her deepest apologies for assuming it'd be an easy victory. He's certainly hopeless when it comes to a sword fight, but as for the battle of spirits, Rose has completely lost.",

                "\"You'll perish with my next attack.\"",

                "Which is why she chooses to end it quickly. If he keeps this up, he'll get up until he dies. That and... she didn't want to kill a promising young fighter.",

                "No one is cheering in the arena anymore. Everyone watches the boy in horror.",

                "Her sword reaches the apex of magic on this day. The sky quakes, and the people in the audience, concerned, mumble to one another.",

                "\"This... can't be.\"",

                "Her gaze remains focused on the artifact as her pen begins twirling across the paper.",

                "She doesn't seem cognizant of the chaos around her. The explosive sounds, the footsteps in the hallway—all of this is beyond her scope of awareness.",

                "\"What's going on?\"",

                "\"Someone is attacking the school.\"",

                "\"You can't use magic, so don't be careless.\"",

                "Even the conversation between the two knights doesn't reach her ears.",

                "\"But how...? There's no way...\"",

                "She's completely fixated on the artifact. She tends to forget her surroundings during her research, but it's never been this extreme. There's something important about that relic that's captured her attention.",

                "Her quill makes crisp movements across the paper.",

                "Those light-pink eyes come one step closer to uncovering the truth.",

                "At that moment, a man in jet-black comes crashing through the window of the lab. Flying shards of glass leave small cuts on Sherry's face.",

                "\"What the...?!\"",

                "\"Who goes there?!\"",

                "The two knights ready their swords. The stinging sensation in her cheeks finally makes Sherry aware of the situation.",

                "\"Huh? What?\"",

                "She grabs the artifact and crawls under her desk to hide. After touching her cheek, she finds a little blood on her hand.",

                "\"We are the Shadow Garden. Or was it the Shadow Guardian? Oh, who gives a crap. I'm Rex. Rex, the Game of Betrayal.\" He scoffs behind his mask. \"This thing is such a nuisance.\"",

                "He flings his mask aside, revealing a flippant man with dull red hair, laughing with the eyes of a starving, feral dog.",

                "\"Eek.\" The mask lands near Sherry's feet, causing her to back away, still concealed.",

                "\"You're the Shadow Garden I've heard so damn much about...\"",

                "\"I don't know your motives, but did you really think you could get away with attacking the school?\"",

                "Rex chuckles. \"I guess that'd be too easy. Oh, the Shadow Garden has it tough. By the way...\" He stops midsentence. \"I forgot why we're attacking.\"",

                "He cackles evilly.",

                "\"Stop messing around.\"",

                "\"Oh, but I'm serious. Though that doesn't matter. My job is to acquire the artifact. Once I have it, you can struggle and squirm to your heart's content...\"",

                "Rex narrows his eyes sharply.",

                "\"Do you know where it is?\" He glares at the knights.",

                "\"...I have no idea what you're talking about.\"",

                "\"We know nothing.\"",

                "The air quivers, and his magic overpowers the room.",

                "\"A—...!\" Sherry clasps her hands over her mouth to prevent herself from screaming as she crawls. It's just a bit farther to the door.",

                "\"So who wants to go first?\" Rex's ravenous, feral gaze scours the room.",

                "\"Let's start with the girl.\"",

                "He disappears into thin air. That's when Sherry realizes he's standing before her.",

                "\"Aaaaaaahhhh!\"",

                "\"Farewell.\"",

                "\"No!\" Sherry closes her eyes as she covers her head, huddling.",

                "\"I won't let you!\"",

                "The sword hurls toward her and strikes the floor.",

                "Sherry fearfully peeks through her clenched eyes to find a stocky knight—with a beard as bushy as a lion's mane—standing in front of her with his sword at the ready.",

                "\"Ooh, impressive. Considering you're working without magic.\"",

                "\"Magic isn't everything. If I'm fighting a weakling, I can easily dodge any attack.\"",

                "\"Weakling...? Damn buffoon. Do you really think you're stronger than me?\" Rex ferociously scowls at the large man.",

                "\"I do.\"",

                "\"Why don't you tell me your name?\"",

                "\"I am Glen, the Lion's Mane, vice commander of the Crimson Order.\"",

                "Another knight lines up next to him.",

                "\"I didn't ask you.\"",

                "In that last moment, Marco looks down at Sherry.",

                "\"Run.\"",

                "With that, the battle begins.",

                "Sherry crawls into the hallway and proceeds to sprint at full speed. She covers her ears to muffle the bloodcurdling screams behind her.",

                "I walk onto the rooftop and peer down at the campus.",

                "I can see all the faculty bound up by the auditorium, which is a massive hall that can easily fit all the students. It's where the school hosts its entrance ceremonies and the occasional lecture by a public figure or a theatrical performance.",

                "The Knight Order has gathered outside the campus in response to the commotion, but there's a clear threshold beyond which they aren't advancing. That could be the boundary of whatever's blocking everyone's magic. There didn't seem to be any students left in the school buildings, just men in black scrounging for anyone still hiding.",

                "I scoff as I look down at the school.",

                "I've always wanted to do this.",

                "I peer at the ravaged school, the shackled students, and the mysterious terrorist organization. I can cross this off my bucket list.",

                "Gaze down at the campus from the rooftop. Check.",

                "Well, I guess I'll have some fun before it gets dark. The truth is, I realized something when the men in jet-black barged into class.",

                "They have no sense of style.",

                "Imagine a light breeze, a clear blue sky, a sunny afternoon—and someone coming out onstage in a long black cloak. Who does that?",

                "Unheard of.",

                "They made one dire mistake. Right... They've underestimated the importance of TPO: There's a Time, Place, and Occasion for everything. If you don't adhere to it, fashion sense will be totally out of whack. Their disregard for TPO is tacky. I mean, black cloaks should only be worn at night.",

                "I'm planning on taking them out nice and slow; time isn't an issue. I would rather hold out and savor the fun.",

                "Which is why I'm going with the strategy Operation: Slow 'n' Steady Till Nightfall.",

                "I'm thinking all this as I observe the campus when I spot two men in black walking down the corridors. Yuck, wearing jet-black on a sunny day? Talk about uncool.",

                "Yeah... they make me want to play sniper.",

                "I slice off a thumb-size piece of slime from my suit. I roll it into a ball, infuse it with magic, lay it on the rooftop, and prepare to give it a good flick.",

                "\"You're in my line of fire, you dummies,\" I mutter to myself, then send it flying.",

                "Whiz. Zooming through the air, my slime ball zips through one of their skulls.",

                "\"Augh...\"",

                "In the same way, I pierce the second man's heart. I've already defeated them in two hits. Unbelievable. I'm bummed. I was in the mood to launch one more.",

                "\"Oh well. My next target is...\"",

                "With my slime bomb at the ready, I close one eye to scope out my next victim.",

                "In the school building across from me, I spot a defenseless blockhead.",

                "\"Target acquired. It's a girl with light-pink hair... Wait, what?\"",

                "That's Sherry.",

                "What's she doing over there? She's giving herself away by blatantly looking back after each step.",

                "\"Sherry, you're blowing your cover.\"",

                "I confirm that a man in black is lunging at Sherry from behind. I lock onto my slime bomb target... and shoot.",

                "Whir.",

                "\"Mission complete.\"",

                "Completely oblivious, Sherry keeps moving until she disappears from view.",

                "Hmm. I wonder what's up.",

                "My normie senses are tingling, telling me there's a major cutscene about to happen. And then, right around the climax, I shall grace the stage as the mastermind behind it all...",

                "Ooh, I can't wait.",

                "Okay, here I go. I infuse my legs with magic and bound into the air when no one's looking.",

                "\"Yahoo!\"",

                "I safely land on the school building across the way. After that, I jump down, grab hold of a window ledge, and swing into the building. I glance around the hallway... and there she is.",

                "The girl with light-pink hair looks around like a gopher.",

                "\"Like I said, you're blowing your cover.\"",

                "There's a man in jet-black behind Sherry. Right before he grabs her, I rush at him at full speed.",

                "\"Huh?\" Sherry senses something moving and looks behind her.",

                "She hears a whoosh... but no one is there. A silent hallway extends into the distance.",

                "\"Maybe I'm just paranoid...?\"",

                "Sherry cautiously peers around her, her shoes lightly tapping against the floor. She presses the artifact against her chest.",

                "Just a moment ago, the knights said they couldn't use magic. If that's true, it would mean it has something to do with her, and she might know what caused it. And in terms of the artifact...",

                "Sherry hugs it tightly one more time.",

                "\"I've got to do something about this...!\"",

                "The image of the two knights bravely fighting to help her escape floats into her mind. She knows she can't let them die in vain.",

                "Wrestling with these thoughts, she turns the corner.",

                "\"Ack!\"",

                "There's a man in black. Sherry panics and attempts to conceal herself.",

                "She thinks she's done for. She swears they lock eyes.",

                "There's another whish.",

                "\"It's fine. I'm still good... I haven't been caught...\" Sherry prays as she looks ahead once more...\"Phew, I'm still safe...\"",

                "Her ebony assailant has vanished.",

                "She bravely yet cautiously surveys the area while her shoes tap rhythmically on the floor.",

                "\"Oh!\"",

                "Another of the enemies gazes down the hall from the classroom window.",

                "Sherry tries to hide in a frenzy, but it's too late. The door swings open to reveal the man in jet-black.",

                "\"Eep!\" Sherry covers her head and closes her eyes.",

                "\"Phew. They haven't found me...\"",

                "Sherry braces herself even more as her feet softly patter against the floor. She checks every inch of the hallway, the classrooms, and, most obviously, behind her. Her eyes flicker left and right. She's surveying the area when she trips over herself.",

                "\"Oof!\" She crashes on the ground, looking up in time to see the artifact whirling into the air.",

                "\"Ahhh!\"",

                "It's about to crash onto the floor... when someone catches it. Sherry glances up to find her newest friend.",

                "\"And your tap-tap-tapping down the hall is super-loud. Let's start with taking off your loafers.\"",

                "Sherry nods in response.",

                "I guard Sherry as we head to the back end of the first floor into the assistant principal's office. Oh, and I secretly kill five more of them along the way.",

                "We open a thick door and walk in.",

                "There's a tasteful lounge in the center of the room and an entire wall stacked with oversized books. Files are piled high on a desk in the back. Sunlight gently pours in from the northern window. It's obviously a space for proper adults.",

                "Sherry sits at a desk she seems to know well and rummages through the drawers.",

                "I'm beat.",

                "I know Sherry is the main character, but there's no way this is going to work out. She won't be able to beat the Final Boss. Under these circumstances, it's normal for the character to have a sidekick, but I don't sense any allies around here. It's a flawed scenario.",

                "But after significant consideration, I've decided to intervene as the savior type of background character. I'm an extra who will never act where others can see—never ever.",

                "\"Found it.\" Sherry comes back from the desk with a pile of documents, spreading them across the coffee table.",

                "\"What's this?\" I don't know anything about these strange alphabets, landforms, or formulas.",

                "\"This artifact is called the Eye of Avarice. I believe this is what's currently blocking our magic.\"",

                "She shows me a sketch of an ominous-looking sphere that's the size of a Ping-Pong ball.",

                "\"The Eye absorbs and collects the magic around it. When it's activated, it's harder to hone magic in the area.\"",

                "\"But the men in black had no problems using magic.\"",

                "\"They must have programmed the Eye to recognize their magical wavelength. I've already confirmed it doesn't consume preregistered magic. It also has difficulties absorbing microscopic particles with powerful energy, but neither of us would recognize those in the first place.\"",

                "Hey.",

                "\"And as if that's not troubling enough, it can also use the magic stored inside it. I'm guessing they were originally planning to use this artifact as a weapon, but it can't store magic for long periods. I believe it's defective.\"",

                "\"But it's effective in the short-term, even if it can't store the power very long.\"",

                "\"Correct. Right now, there are hundreds of dark knights held hostage in the auditorium. In theory, if they released the magic in the artifact... they might just be able to obliterate the school.\"",

                "\"That's a real dirty pendant you got there.\"",

                "\"This seems to control it. The Eye cannot move on its own; I believe it can only be used when attached to this device. When they act together, the artifact is no longer defective and is limited to storing magic short-term.\"",

                "\"I would have to put them together and experiment to know for sure. But yes, I believe it's possible.\"",

                "\"Huh.\"",

                "\"Um... they're vigilantly patrolling the ground level, so I think we might have to get closer underground.\" Sherry smiles somewhat nervously.",

                "\"Underground?\"",

                "\"Yes.\" Sherry takes a few books off the bookshelf, and it swings back to reveal a staircase leading to a lower level.",

                "\"Ah, Assistant Principal Lutheran. He adopted you, right?\"",

                "\"He used to help my mother with her research, and he's taken care of me for as long as I can remember. Even after Mother died and I had nowhere to go, he took me under his wing and raised me as his own.\"",

There are three floors in the enormous, drafty auditorium, and all of the exits are guarded by men enshrouded in jet-black. The students are being monitored and not allowed to make a single peep.

My best guess is the latter was stabbed by a rapier. All of them were only struck once. The enemy seems dexterous,\" comments Rex, sniggering like a ravenous wolf.",

                "\"Well, well... perhaps it's the Shadow Garden. The bait has finally worked.\"",

                "\"Seems that way. You might want to watch your back.\"",

                "\"What the—?\"",

                "Rex scans the area to determine what it was, but there aren't any suspicious shadows around him. The only hint he has is a whoosh in the air.",

                "Buzz, zip. A sound slices through space.",

                "\"Nng...!\"",

                "And the lackey next to Rex is gone.",

                "But this time, he manages to catch a glimpse of it. There was a boy in a school uniform—drenched in blood. Using the heel of his palm, the boy knocked the man out and stole him away.",

                "Rex powers up, intensifying his vision to its limit and focusing his gaze. Only then can he detect these rapid movements.",

                "\"Stay alert! Enemy!\" Rex shouts, vigilantly scoping the area. \"...Oh?\"",

                "He stands in place, bewildered.",

                "The subordinates who were at his back are gone. Before he's realized it, he's standing alone in the corridor.",

                "Then there's a whiz.",

                "Hearing it, Rex immediately channels all his strength into protecting his heart.",

                "The heel of someone's palm hits his arm.",

                "Crack. The force of it snaps Rex's bones and sends him flying backward.",

                "\"That... little shit!!\" Rex promptly resets his stance and brandishes his sword.",

                "But no one's there. He clucks his tongue in frustration.",

                "A single palm strike has broken the bones in his left arm, which he'd been protecting with magic. His heart might have shattered if he hadn't shielded himself when he did.",

                "Whish. Rex moves with the noise, tuning in to the presence behind him and swinging. His timing is perfect.",

                "The runt... is getting faster! How dare he! Rex takes stabs at the air behind the boy, quickly resuming his posture with the sole aim of protecting his heart.",

                "\"Agh...!\"",

                "He suffers a blow to the ribs.",

                "Rex jumps back to reduce the impact as he tracks the boy with his eyes. He can barely make out his afterimage.",

                "\"Ts...\" Rex hacks out a mix of saliva and blood and stands on the defensive.",

                "It's nearly impossible to detect the enemy, and countering is out of the question. Only he's taking damage. From an objective standpoint, there's no graver situation. But... Rex has a wealth of experience worming himself out from between a rock and a hard place.",

                "For he is Rex, a Named Child.",

                "\"That's a handy artifact you're using,\" Rex comments so his enemy can hear.",

                "He's figured out the enemy's shtick.",

                "It doesn't take him long to piece it together. His opponent moves faster than humanly possible, which means he requires extraordinary power to keep it up.",

                "\"At first glance, I have the disadvantage. But you can't fool me. You're pushing yourself, right?\"",

                "With inhuman speed comes sacrifice. He sees the traces of it already.",

                "\"Don't you know your uniform is covered in blood?\"",

                "Yes... Rex solved the riddle when he saw the red uniform: His opponent used the power of the artifact to achieve logic-defying speeds. And in exchange, it's wearing him down. It's clear from the rivers of blood pouring out of his enemy. The boy will reach his limit. If Rex can hold out until then... victory is his.",

                "That's Rex, the Game of Betrayal, the Named Child, who can completely expose his victims with minimal information.",

                "\"I'd guess that you have a few hits left. That's when you'll have reached your limit!\" Rex declares in a powerful voice.",

                "But his enemy doesn't reply. He's been silent and still ever since Rex started his little speech.",

                "\"Guess I've hit the nail on the head.\" The corners of Rex's lips form a sinister smile.",

                "He can see his victory. But... it's not as easy as Rex makes it out to be. In fact, he still has to evade the undetectable palm strike a few more times.",

                "\"Hey, why so silent?\" Rex starts feeling confident, refusing to show any sign of weakness.",

                "This battle is one of... intense psychological warfare.",

                "\"Come out, you chicken!\"",

                "Whoosh.",

                "Just as the sound rushes through the air, Rex evades the attack using only his instincts, twisting his upper body to avoid the trajectory of his hand.",

                "That fast?! He uses his right arm as a shield at the very last second.",

                "\"Gaaaah!!\"",

                "It snaps in every possible place. He backs away, retaining his grip on his sword through sheer determination.",

                "And yet, his opponent persists. Rex has only seen the enemy's most basic moves, and he's drawing near.",

                "In other words... this is the turning point in their battle.",

                "\"Come at meeeeeeeeee!!\" Rex shrieks as he protects his weak points.",

                "His enemy has reached his limit. If Rex can endure this final strike, victory is his.",

                "Seconds later, a palm slams into his stomach.",

                "\"Gah!! Aaaaaghhhh!!\"",

                "Rex vomits a stream of blood as he's thrown backward. He blasts through the wall into a classroom, tumbling into desks and chairs before crashing onto the ground.",

                "\"Kah-kah...!\" Clutching his stomach, he coughs up blood. His ribs tear his internal organs.",

                "But... he's alive. Guarding with all his might pays off.",

                "\"Heh-heh...\" Rex's bloody lips curl into a sneer as he lifts his head.",

                "Corpses lie in a heap in the classroom.",

                "All of them are men in black. It's clear they hardly bear any wounds; each was slain with a single attack.",

                "Did that one child kill all these Named Children by himself...?",

                "There's no one there.",

                "With a whir, Rex's right arm is ripped to pieces.",

                "Marco was supposed to be Nu's husband in their arranged marriage.",

                "They sent many letters to each other and shared dances at the ball. But in the end, he was nothing but the man her parents chose for her. She never knew how he felt about the situation, but she could never bring herself to love him.",

                "But she doesn't necessarily hate him. She may not have loved him, but she thought he was kind. She wouldn't have minded marrying him one day. She imagines that tying the knot with a respectable man would have led to a bright future.",

                "An arranged path, an arranged partner, an arranged future. Nu never used to have much of an opinion. In the past, she conformed to the values of those around her and lived as per their dictates. She didn't mind at the time. But looking back on it now, she finds that lifestyle terribly confining.",

                "As she gazes at his face, she suddenly remembers the ball. Nu wryly smiles as she recalls showing off Marco's attractive face around it like some kind of accessory.",

                "Her foster father was her savior. He took her in, supported her research, and gave her a loving family. Through that, Sherry finally regained her voice. Almost all her memories of family are of him.",

                "Her enemies may be few, but they're all too powerful to neglect. Plus, they're terribly efficient. Of the group, a man known as Rex and his superior officer, Sir Gaunt, are immensely stronger than the rest. The professors who underestimated and opposed them have been helplessly slain. Even if the hostages could use magic, their chances of winning would be questionable.",

Judging by his appearance and dense magic, Rose believes he can surpass an expert fighter. He might even be able to topple Iris Midgar... not that she wants to believe it. If that's true, Rose's chances of defeating him—even if she regains her magic—are remarkably low to none.",

                "As the minutes elapse, Rose can feel magic slipping out of her body. She doesn't know the reason, but her best guess is that it's related to the phenomenon that blocks it. Even though Rose is far from feeling weak, the students with less magic are starting to feel sick. In a few more hours, some of them may even suffer from magic deficiency, which means they'll lose the chance to fight back forever.",

                "But her combat style is also reckless, and she doesn't give her internal regulation of magic a second thought. Her power may be immense, but it's leaving her body, and she's rapidly approaching her limit. She can feel it as she calmly keeps an eye on her cap. Her magic is slipping away, causing her swordplay to dull as her body grows heavy.",

                "One-hit kills become two hits, then three.",

                "His swordsmanship is far superior to hers. His abilities are the result of assiduous training, of eliminating excess, of honing, of integrating varied techniques. Rose feels as if time has ground down to a halt. She's never seen swordsmanship as flawless as this.",

                "\"Come to me... My loyal servants...\"",

                "Shadow releases magic with a blue-violet hue into the sky. As Rose bathes in that light, a group clad entirely in black drops into the auditorium.",

                "Flinging his coat open, he slices open the auditorium doors with a single stroke of his sword. As an added bonus, the opponents in his vicinity become mounds of unmoving flesh.",

                "Rose can feel her common sense—no, her common sense as a dark knight—shattering into pieces. The swordsmanship exhibited by these warriors doesn't fit into any preexisting molds.",

                "The boy sits cross-legged on the sofa, reading a book. He's average-looking with black hair—a dime a dozen. But he doesn't even glance at the flames that spread from the shadow. His gaze is focused instead on a thick book. The sound of turning pages echoes throughout the room.",

                "\"How perceptive of you,\" notes the man, removing his mask to reveal a middle-aged face.",

                "It is indeed Assistant Principal Lutheran, sporting gray streaks in his slicked-back hair.",

                "\"I've heard you won the Bushin Festival.\"",

                "\"Yes, but that's nowhere near my proudest moment. The height of my career was greater than that. You wouldn't understand if I told you.\"",

                "Lutheran grins. He doesn't seem to be speaking facetiously but appears somewhat tired instead.",

                "\"Soon after I peaked, I fell terribly ill and was forced to retire. After years of struggle, all my honor instantly evaporated. As I was searching for a way to cure my illness, I found potential in an artifact researcher named Lukreia.\"",

As a researcher, she possessed knowledge that was unmatched, and I found her beneficial to me. I supported her work and gathered artifacts for her, and she focused on her research, which I later used. She wasn't interested in fame or fortune, so we got along just fine. And then I stumbled upon the Eye of Avarice. It was the artifact for which I'd been searching. But you see, Lukreia... that stupid woman claimed it was unsafe, and she was about to request the nation store it for her. Which is why I killed her. After I cut her from her extremities inward, I impaled her heart and twisted my blade.\"",

                "\"I acquired the Eye, but the research was incomplete. That's when I conveniently met another researcher—Sherry, Lukreia's daughter. She was naive and unknowing, catering to my every whim. She never knew I was the enemy, that sweet, stupid child. Thanks to mother and daughter, the Eye is now complete. All I had to do was set the stage to gather magic and prepare the perfect camouflage. Today... will be my greatest day, when all my dreams will come true.\"",

                "Lutheran spitefully chortles to himself. \"How's that for reference?\"",

Lutheran used an artifact to seal the magic of all his students, but that would obviously never stop Master Shadow! While the students were taken hostage, Master Shadow plucked off the terrorists from the shadows, one by one.",

The Unbeaten Legend has finally been broken. News of his defeat spreads among the tournament fanatics like wildfire. Even though it's still just the prelims, Goldy the Unbeaten Legend is a dark knight to whom people pay attention. They are astonished to hear he's lost to some nobody named Mundane, but their shock dwindles when they are told how the fight went down. Oh, sounds like he just won by some fluke. That is more or less how most of the fanatics see it. However, a few of them\u2014along with some of the people who have actually been watching the match\u2014have doubts about how Mundane is being assessed. Because of that, they decide to attend Mundane's matches and judge his strength firsthand.\"", "What's this?!", "Quinton is down!!", "And he's not getting back up!!", "Mundane wins another match with a single blow!", "!\" The B-Block finals for the preliminary rounds end with Mundane's victory. Another one-hit win. The fanatics can't figure out what to make of him. That day's victory qualifies him for the primary rounds, but nobody is quite sure how he's actually done it. There's no way he could have won so many times off pure luck, so he has to have at least some skill. In fact, his opponent in the prelim finals, Quinton, was a dark knight held in high estimation by the enthusiastic crowd. The fact that Quinton lost to Mundane without being able to put up a fight leaves the fanatics with little choice but to acknowledge Mundane's strength. However, because they can't figure out how he won, they can't really pin down his true strength. He's probably stronger than Quinton, but is he really fit to stand atop the main stage? He might be strong, but can he really stack up against the historic winners of the Bushin Festival? Arguments on the topic are heated. In the end, most people decide he's probably on the weaker end among the combatants scheduled to appear in the primaries. Considering his lack of history, that's to be expected. Everyone else has earned his or her reputation in tournaments or on the battlefield, but Mundane has no notches in his belt to compare against theirs. Objectively speaking, Mundane has nothing that proves his worth. So, of course, expectations for him are low. Still, a couple of the fanatics think he's a dark horse. Given the list of contestants this time around, it's pretty much a guarantee that Iris is going to take the Bushin Festival this year, but if anyone can upset her... it's probably the miracle boy whose strength is yet unknown. Such are the expectations being foisted upon Mundane as he leaves the arena. The primaries start the following week. Round one is Mundane Mann versus Annerose. Ninety percent of people expect Annerose to take the match. As I leave the stage, I think how the older guy I fought today seemed oddly feisty. His name was Qui... something or other. I could literally feel the hostility emanating from him. It was kinda invigorating. Now I've qualified for the primary rounds that start next week. The crowd's been pretty unimpressed with me so far, but next week is when I'm gonna show off my true strength, so I need to run through some scenarios in the interim.

with superficial respect while using her for their own ends.", "That's why she's opted to leave the politics to others and gather strength in areas in which she's more skilled.", "For example, she knows that popularity among the masses is a strength in and of itself.", "She's also gathered allies she trusts to be the brains behind her Order.", "All that's left todo is win the Bushin Festival
